### 1.Visually Guided Sound Source Separation using Cascaded Opponent Filter Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03028.pdf)
>  The objective of this paper is to recover the original component signals from a mixture audio with the aid of visual cues of the sound sources. Such task is usually referred as visually guided sound source separation. The proposed Cascaded Opponent Filter (COF) framework consists of multiple stages, which recursively refine the sound separation based on appearance and motion information. A key element is a novel opponent filter module that identifies and relocates residual components between sound sources. Finally, we propose a Sound Source Location Masking (SSLM) technique, which, together with COF, produces a pixel level mask of the source location. The entire system is trained end-to-end using a large set of unlabelled videos. We compare COF with recent baselines and obtain state-of-the-art performance in three challenging datasets (MUSIC, A-MUSIC, and A-NATURAL). The implementation and pre-trained models will be made publicly available.      
### 2.A Siamese Neural Network with Modified Distance Loss For Transfer Learning in Speech Emotion Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03001.pdf)
>  Automatic emotion recognition plays a significant role in the process of human computer interaction and the design of Internet of Things (IOT) technologies. Yet, a common problem in emotion recognition systems lies in the scarcity of reliable labels. By modeling pairwise differences between samples of interest, a Siamese network can help to mitigate this challenge since it requires fewer samples than traditional deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a distance loss, which can be applied on the Siamese network fine-tuning, by optimizing the model based on the relevant distance between same and difference class pairs. Our system use samples from the source data to pre-train the weights of proposed Siamese neural network, which are fine-tuned based on the target data. We present an emotion recognition task that uses speech, since it is one of the most ubiquitous and frequently used bio-behavioral signals. Our target data comes from the RAVDESS dataset, while the CREMA-D and eNTERFACE'05 are used as source data, respectively. Our results indicate that the proposed distance loss is able to greatly benefit the fine-tuning process of Siamese network. Also, the selection of source data has more effect on the Siamese network performance compared to the number of frozen layers. These suggest the great potential of applying the Siamese network and modelling pairwise differences in the field of transfer learning for automatic emotion recognition.      
### 3.RarePlanes: Synthetic Data Takes Flight  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02963.pdf)
>  RarePlanes is a unique open-source machine learning dataset that incorporates both real and synthetically generated satellite imagery. The RarePlanes dataset specifically focuses on the value of synthetic data to aid computer vision algorithms in their ability to automatically detect aircraft and their attributes in satellite imagery. Although other synthetic/real combination datasets exist, RarePlanes is the largest openly-available very-high resolution dataset built to test the value of synthetic data from an overhead perspective. Previous research has shown that synthetic data can reduce the amount of real training data needed and potentially improve performance for many tasks in the computer vision domain. The real portion of the dataset consists of 253 Maxar WorldView-3 satellite scenes spanning 112 locations and 2,142 km^2 with 14,700 hand-annotated aircraft. The accompanying synthetic dataset is generated via a novel simulation platform and features 50,000 synthetic satellite images with ~630,000 aircraft annotations. Both the real and synthetically generated aircraft feature 10 fine grain attributes including: aircraft length, wingspan, wing-shape, wing-position, wingspan class, propulsion, number of engines, number of vertical-stabilizers, presence of canards, and aircraft role. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the real and synthetic datasets and compare performances. By doing so, we show the value of synthetic data for the task of detecting and classifying aircraft from an overhead perspective.      
### 4.2D Image Features Detector And Descriptor Selection Expert System  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02933.pdf)
>  Detection and description of keypoints from an image is a well-studied problem in Computer Vision. Some methods like SIFT, SURF or ORB are computationally really efficient. This paper proposes a solution for a particular case study on object recognition of industrial parts based on hierarchical classification. Reducing the number of instances leads to better performance, indeed, that is what the use of the hierarchical classification is looking for. We demonstrate that this method performs better than using just one method like ORB, SIFT or FREAK, despite being fairly slower.      
### 5.Multiple Generative Adversarial Networks Analysis for Predicting Photographers' Retouching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02921.pdf)
>  Anyone can take a photo, but not everybody has the ability to retouch their pictures and obtain result close to professional. Since it is not possible to ask experts to retouch thousands of pictures, we thought about teaching a piece of software how to reproduce the work of those said experts. This study aims to explore the possibility to use deep learning methods and more specifically, generative adversarial networks (GANs), to mimic artists' retouching and find which one of the studied models provides the best results.      
### 6.Look Locally Infer Globally: A Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02834.pdf)
>  State-of-the-art spoof detection methods tend to overfit to the spoof types seen during training and fail to generalize to unknown spoof types. Given that face anti-spoofing is inherently a local task, we propose a face anti-spoofing framework, namely Self-Supervised Regional Fully Convolutional Network (SSR-FCN), that is trained to learn local discriminative cues from a face image in a self-supervised manner. The proposed framework improves generalizability while maintaining the computational efficiency of holistic face anti-spoofing approaches (&lt; 4 ms on a Nvidia GTX 1080Ti GPU). The proposed method is interpretable since it localizes which parts of the face are labeled as spoofs. Experimental results show that SSR-FCN can achieve TDR = 65% @ 2.0% FDR when evaluated on a dataset comprising of 13 different spoof types under unknown attacks while achieving competitive performances under standard benchmark datasets (Oulu-NPU, CASIA-MFSD, and Replay-Attack).      
### 7.Event-based visual place recognition with ensembles of spatio-temporal windows  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02826.pdf)
>  Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors capable of providing a continuous stream of events with low latency and high dynamic range. As a single event only carries limited information about the brightness change at a particular pixel, events are commonly accumulated into spatio-temporal windows for further processing. However, the optimal window length varies depending on the scene, camera motion, the task being performed, and other factors. In this research, we develop a novel ensemble-based scheme for combining spatio-temporal windows of varying lengths that are processed in parallel. For applications where the increased computational requirements of this approach are not practical, we also introduce a new "approximate" ensemble scheme that achieves significant computational efficiencies without unduly compromising the original performance gains provided by the ensemble approach. We demonstrate our ensemble scheme on the visual place recognition (VPR) task, introducing a new Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset with annotated recordings captured using a DAVIS346 color event camera. We show that our proposed ensemble scheme significantly outperforms all the single-window baselines and conventional model-based ensembles, irrespective of the image reconstruction and feature extraction methods used in the VPR pipeline, and evaluate which ensemble combination technique performs best. These results demonstrate the significant benefits of ensemble schemes for event camera processing in the VPR domain and may have relevance to other related processes, including feature tracking, visual-inertial odometry, and steering prediction in driving.      
### 8.A Computational Model of Early Word Learning from the Infant's Point of View  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02802.pdf)
>  Human infants have the remarkable ability to learn the associations between object names and visual objects from inherently ambiguous experiences. Researchers in cognitive science and developmental psychology have built formal models that implement in-principle learning algorithms, and then used pre-selected and pre-cleaned datasets to test the abilities of the models to find statistical regularities in the input data. In contrast to previous modeling approaches, the present study used egocentric video and gaze data collected from infant learners during natural toy play with their parents. This allowed us to capture the learning environment from the perspective of the learner's own point of view. We then used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to process sensory data from the infant's point of view and learn name-object associations from scratch. As the first model that takes raw egocentric video to simulate infant word learning, the present study provides a proof of principle that the problem of early word learning can be solved, using actual visual data perceived by infant learners. Moreover, we conducted simulation experiments to systematically determine how visual, perceptual, and attentional properties of infants' sensory experiences may affect word learning.      
### 9.Height estimation from single aerial images using a deep ordinal regression network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02801.pdf)
>  Understanding the 3D geometric structure of the Earth's surface has been an active research topic in photogrammetry and remote sensing community for decades, serving as an essential building block for various applications such as 3D digital city modeling, change detection, and city management. Previous researches have extensively studied the problem of height estimation from aerial images based on stereo or multi-view image matching. These methods require two or more images from different perspectives to reconstruct 3D coordinates with camera information provided. In this paper, we deal with the ambiguous and unsolved problem of height estimation from a single aerial image. Driven by the great success of deep learning, especially deep convolution neural networks (CNNs), some researches have proposed to estimate height information from a single aerial image by training a deep CNN model with large-scale annotated datasets. These methods treat height estimation as a regression problem and directly use an encoder-decoder network to regress the height values. In this paper, we proposed to divide height values into spacing-increasing intervals and transform the regression problem into an ordinal regression problem, using an ordinal loss for network training. To enable multi-scale feature extraction, we further incorporate an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to extract features from multiple dilated convolution layers. After that, a post-processing technique is designed to transform the predicted height map of each patch into a seamless height map. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significantly better performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 10.GAN-Based Facial Attractiveness Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02766.pdf)
>  We propose a generative framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) to enhance facial attractiveness while preserving facial identity and high-fidelity. Given a portrait image as input, having applied gradient descent to recover a latent vector that this generative framework can use to synthesize an image resemble to the input image, beauty semantic editing manipulation on the corresponding recovered latent vector based on InterFaceGAN enables this framework to achieve facial image beautification. This paper compared our system with Beholder-GAN and our proposed result-enhanced version of Beholder-GAN. It turns out that our framework obtained state-of-art attractiveness enhancement results.

### 11.Self-paced Contrastive Learning with Hybrid Memory for Domain Adaptive Object Re-ID  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02713.pdf)
>  Domain adaptive object re-ID aims to transfer the learned knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain to tackle the open-class re-identification problems. Although state-of-the-art pseudo-label-based methods have achieved great success, they did not make full use of all valuable information because of the domain gap and unsatisfying clustering performance. To solve these problems, we propose a novel self-paced contrastive learning framework with hybrid memory. The hybrid memory dynamically generates source-domain class-level, target-domain cluster-level and un-clustered instance-level supervisory signals for learning feature representations. Different from the conventional contrastive learning strategy, the proposed framework jointly distinguishes source-domain classes, and target-domain clusters and un-clustered instances. Most importantly, the proposed self-paced method gradually creates more reliable clusters to refine the hybrid memory and learning targets, and is shown to be the key to our outstanding performance. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple domain adaptation tasks of object re-ID and even boosts the performance on the source domain without any extra annotations. Our generalized version on unsupervised person re-ID surpasses state-of-the-art algorithms by considerable 16.2% and 14.6% on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID benchmarks.

### 12.Unsupervised Depth Learning in Challenging Indoor Video: Weak Rectification to Rescue  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02708.pdf)
>  Single-view depth estimation using CNNs trained from unlabelled videos has shown significant promise. However, the excellent results have mostly been obtained in street-scene driving scenarios, and such methods often fail in other settings, particularly indoor videos taken by handheld devices, in which case the ego-motion is often degenerate, i.e., the rotation dominates the translation. In this work, we establish that the degenerate camera motions exhibited in handheld settings are a critical obstacle for unsupervised depth learning. A main contribution of our work is fundamental analysis which shows that the rotation behaves as noise during training, as opposed to the translation (baseline) which provides supervision signals. To capitalise on our findings, we propose a novel data pre-processing method for effective training, i.e., we search for image pairs with modest translation and remove their rotation via the proposed weak image rectification. With our pre-processing, existing unsupervised models can be trained well in challenging scenarios (e.g., NYUv2 dataset), and the results outperform the unsupervised SOTA by a large margin (0.147 vs. 0.189 in the AbsRel error).      
### 13.LRNNet: A Light-Weighted Network with Efficient Reduced Non-Local Operation for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02706.pdf)
>  The recent development of light-weighted neural networks has promoted the applications of deep learning under resource constraints and mobile applications. Many of these applications need to perform a real-time and efficient prediction for semantic segmentation with a light-weighted network. This paper introduces a light-weighted network with an efficient reduced non-local module (LRNNet) for efficient and realtime semantic segmentation. We proposed a factorized convolutional block in ResNet-Style encoder to achieve more lightweighted, efficient and powerful feature extraction. Meanwhile, our proposed reduced non-local module utilizes spatial regional dominant singular vectors to achieve reduced and more representative non-local feature integration with much lower computation and memory cost. Experiments demonstrate our superior trade-off among light-weight, speed, computation and accuracy. Without additional processing and pretraining, LRNNet achieves 72.2% mIoU on Cityscapes test dataset only using the fine annotation data for training with only 0.68M parameters and with 71 FPS on a GTX 1080Ti card.      
### 14.Boundary-assisted Region Proposal Networks for Nucleus Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02695.pdf)
>  Nucleus segmentation is an important task in medical image analysis. However, machine learning models cannot perform well because there are large amount of clusters of crowded nuclei. To handle this problem, existing approaches typically resort to sophisticated hand-crafted post-processing strategies; therefore, they are vulnerable to the variation of post-processing hyper-parameters. Accordingly, in this paper, we devise a Boundary-assisted Region Proposal Network (BRP-Net) that achieves robust instance-level nucleus segmentation. First, we propose a novel Task-aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) network that efficiently extracts respective high-quality features for semantic segmentation and instance boundary detection tasks. This is achieved by carefully considering the correlation and differences between the two tasks. Second, coarse nucleus proposals are generated based on the predictions of the above two tasks. Third, these proposals are fed into instance segmentation networks for more accurate prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of BRP-Net is robust to the variation of post-processing hyper-parameters. Furthermore, BRP-Net achieves state-of-the-art performances on both the Kumar and CPM17 datasets. The code of BRP-Net will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/csccsccsccsc/brpnet" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.

### 16.Evaluation of Deep Segmentation Models for the Extraction of Retinal Lesions from Multi-modal Retinal Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02662.pdf)
>  Identification of lesions plays a vital role in the accurate classification of retinal diseases and in helping clinicians analyzing the disease severity. In this paper, we present a detailed evaluation of RAGNet, PSPNet, SegNet, UNet, FCN-8 and FCN-32 for the extraction of retinal lesions such as intra-retinal fluid, sub-retinal fluid, hard exudates, drusen, and other chorioretinal anomalies from retinal fundus and OCT scans. We also discuss the transferability of these models for extracting retinal lesions by varying training-testing dataset pairs. A total of 363 fundus and 173,915 OCT scans were considered in this evaluation from seven publicly available datasets from which 297 fundus and 59,593 OCT scans were used for testing purposes. Overall, the best performance is achieved by RAGNet with a mean dice coefficient ($\mathrm{D_C}$) score of 0.822 for extracting retinal lesions. The second-best performance is achieved by PSPNet (mean $\mathrm{D_C}$: 0.785) using ResNet\textsubscript{50} as a backbone. Moreover, the best performance for extracting drusen is achieved by UNet ($\mathrm{D_C}$: 0.864).

### 17.MFPP: Morphological Fragmental Perturbation Pyramid for Black-Box Model Explanations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02659.pdf)
>  With the increasing popularity of deep neural networks (DNNs), it has recently been applied to many advanced and diverse tasks, such as medical diagnosis, automatic pilot etc. Due to the lack of transparency of the deep models, it causes serious concern about widespread deployment of ML/DL technologies. In this work, we address the Explainable AI problem of black-box classifiers which take images as input and output probabilities of classes. We propose a novel technology, the Morphological Fragmental Perturbation Pyramid (MFPP), in which we segment input image into different scales of fragments and randomly mask them as perturbation to generate an importance map that indicates how salient each pixel is for prediction results of the black-box DNNs. Compared to existing input sampling perturbation methods, this pyramid structure fragmentation has proven to be more efficient and it can better explore the morphological information of input image to match its semantic information, while it does not require any values inside model. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that MFPP matches and exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art black-box explanation methods on multiple models and datasets.      
### 18.The Importance of Prior Knowledge in Precise Multimodal Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02636.pdf)
>  Roads have well defined geometries, topologies, and traffic rules. While this has been widely exploited in motion planning methods to produce maneuvers that obey the law, little work has been devoted to utilize these priors in perception and motion forecasting methods. In this paper we propose to incorporate these structured priors as a loss function. In contrast to imposing hard constraints, this approach allows the model to handle non-compliant maneuvers when those happen in the real world. Safe motion planning is the end goal, and thus a probabilistic characterization of the possible future developments of the scene is key to choose the plan with the lowest expected cost. Towards this goal, we design a framework that leverages REINFORCE to incorporate non-differentiable priors over sample trajectories from a probabilistic model, thus optimizing the whole distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world self-driving datasets containing complex road topologies and multi-agent interactions. Our motion forecasts not only exhibit better precision and map understanding, but most importantly result in safer motion plans taken by our self-driving vehicle. We emphasize that despite the importance of this evaluation, it has been often overlooked by previous perception and motion forecasting works.      
### 19.FastReID: A Pytorch Toolbox for Real-world Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02631.pdf)
>  We present FastReID, as a widely used object re-identification (re-id) software system in JD AI Research. High modular and extensible design makes it easy for the researcher to achieve new research ideas. Friendly manageable system configuration and engineering deployment functions allow practitioners to quickly deploy models into productions. We have implemented some state-of-the-art algorithms, including person re-id, partial re-id, cross-domain re-id and vehicle re-id, and plan to release these pre-trained models on multiple benchmark datasets. FastReID is by far the most complete and high-performance toolbox supports single and multiple GPU servers, you can reproduce our project results very easily and are very welcome to use it, the code and models are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/JDAI-CV/fast-reid" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 20.Image Completion and Extrapolation with Contextual Cycle Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02620.pdf)
>  Image Completion refers to the task of filling in the missing regions of an image and Image Extrapolation refers to the task of extending an image at its boundaries while keeping it coherent. Many recent works based on GAN have shown progress in addressing these problem statements but lack adaptability for these two cases, i.e. the neural network trained for the completion of interior masked images does not generalize well for extrapolating over the boundaries and vice-versa. In this paper, we present a technique to train both completion and extrapolation networks concurrently while benefiting each other. We demonstrate our method's efficiency in completing large missing regions and we show the comparisons with the contemporary state of the art baseline.      
### 21.Semi-supervised and Unsupervised Methods for Heart Sounds Classification in Restricted Data Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02610.pdf)
>  Automated heart sounds classification is a much-required diagnostic tool in the view of increasing incidences of heart related diseases worldwide. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive study of heart sounds classification by using various supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches on the PhysioNet/CinC 2016 Challenge dataset. Supervised approaches, including deep learning and machine learning methods, require large amounts of labelled data to train the models, which are challenging to obtain in most practical scenarios. In view of the need to reduce the labelling burden for clinical practices, where human labelling is both expensive and time-consuming, semi-supervised or even unsupervised approaches in restricted data setting are desirable. A GAN based semi-supervised method is therefore proposed, which allows the usage of unlabelled data samples to boost the learning of data distribution. It achieves a better performance in terms of AUROC over the supervised baseline when limited data samples exist. Furthermore, several unsupervised methods are explored as an alternative approach by considering the given problem as an anomaly detection scenario. In particular, the unsupervised feature extraction using 1D CNN Autoencoder coupled with one-class SVM obtains good performance without any data labelling. The potential of the proposed semi-supervised and unsupervised methods may lead to a workflow tool in the future for the creation of higher quality datasets.      
### 22.Simple Unsupervised Multi-Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02609.pdf)
>  Multi-object tracking has seen a lot of progress recently, albeit with substantial annotation costs for developing better and larger labeled datasets. In this work, we remove the need for annotated datasets by proposing an unsupervised re-identification network, thus sidestepping the labeling costs entirely, required for training. Given unlabeled videos, our proposed method (SimpleReID) first generates tracking labels using SORT and trains a ReID network to predict the generated labels using crossentropy loss. We demonstrate that SimpleReID performs substantially better than simpler alternatives, and we recover the full performance of its supervised counterpart consistently across diverse tracking frameworks. The observations are unusual because unsupervised ReID is not expected to excel in crowded scenarios with occlusions, and drastic viewpoint changes. By incorporating our unsupervised SimpleReID with CenterTrack trained on augmented still images, we establish a new state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets like MOT16/17 without using tracking supervision, beating current best (CenterTrack) by 0.2-0.3 MOTA and 4.4-4.8 IDF1 scores. We further provide evidence for limited scope for improvement in IDF1 scores beyond our unsupervised ReID in the studied settings. Our investigation suggests reconsideration towards more sophisticated, supervised, end-to-end trackers by showing promise in simpler unsupervised alternatives.      
### 23.Info3D: Representation Learning on 3D Objects using Mutual Information Maximization and Contrastive Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02598.pdf)
>  A major endeavor of computer vision is to represent, understand and extract structure from 3D data. Towards this goal, unsupervised learning is a powerful and necessary tool. Most current unsupervised methods for 3D shape analysis use datasets that are aligned, require objects to be reconstructed and suffer from deteriorated performance on downstream tasks. To solve these issues, we propose to extend the InfoMax and contrastive learning principles on 3D shapes. We show that we can maximize the mutual information between 3D objects and their "chunks" to improve the representations in aligned datasets. Furthermore, we can achieve rotation invariance in SO${(3)}$ group by maximizing the mutual information between the 3D objects and their geometric transformed versions. Finally, we conduct several experiments such as clustering, transfer learning, shape retrieval, and achieve state of art results.      
### 24.COMET: Context-Aware IoU-Guided Network for Small Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02597.pdf)
>  Tracking an unknown target captured from medium- or high-aerial view is challenging, especially in scenarios of small objects, large viewpoint change, drastic camera motion, and high density. This paper introduces a context-aware IoU-guided tracker that exploits an offline reference proposal generation strategy and a multitask two-stream network. The proposed strategy introduces an efficient sampling strategy to generalize the network on the target and its parts without imposing extra computational complexity during online tracking. It considerably helps the proposed tracker, COMET, to handle occlusion and view-point change, where only some parts of the target are visible. Extensive experimental evaluations on broad range of small object benchmarks (UAVDT, VisDrone-2019, and Small-90) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for small object tracking.      
### 25.Phasic dopamine release identification using ensemble of AlexNet  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02536.pdf)
>  Dopamine (DA) is an organic chemical that influences several parts of behaviour and physical functions. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) is a technique used for in vivo phasic dopamine release measurements. The analysis of such measurements, though, requires notable effort. In this paper, we present the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the identification of phasic dopamine releases.      
### 26.A Survey on Deep Learning Techniques for Stereo-based Depth Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02535.pdf)
>  Estimating depth from RGB images is a long-standing ill-posed problem, which has been explored for decades by the computer vision, graphics, and machine learning communities. Among the existing techniques, stereo matching remains one of the most widely used in the literature due to its strong connection to the human binocular system. Traditionally, stereo-based depth estimation has been addressed through matching hand-crafted features across multiple images. Despite the extensive amount of research, these traditional techniques still suffer in the presence of highly textured areas, large uniform regions, and occlusions. Motivated by their growing success in solving various 2D and 3D vision problems, deep learning for stereo-based depth estimation has attracted growing interest from the community, with more than 150 papers published in this area between 2014 and 2019. This new generation of methods has demonstrated a significant leap in performance, enabling applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of this new and continuously growing field of research, summarize the most commonly used pipelines, and discuss their benefits and limitations. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for deep learning-based stereo for depth estimation research.      
### 27.CircleNet: Anchor-free Detection with Circle Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02474.pdf)
>  Object detection networks are powerful in computer vision, but not necessarily optimized for biomedical object detection. In this work, we propose CircleNet, a simple anchor-free detection method with circle representation for detection of the ball-shaped glomerulus. Different from the traditional bounding box based detection method, the bounding circle (1) reduces the degrees of freedom of detection representation, (2) is naturally rotation invariant, (3) and optimized for ball-shaped objects. The key innovation to enable this representation is the anchor-free framework with the circle detection head. We evaluate CircleNet in the context of detection of glomerulus. CircleNet increases average precision of the glomerulus detection from 0.598 to 0.647. Another key advantage is that CircleNet achieves better rotation consistency compared with bounding box representations.      
### 28.Visual Summarization of Lecture Video Segments for Enhanced Navigation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02434.pdf)
>  Lecture videos are an increasingly important learning resource for higher education. However, the challenge of quickly finding the content of interest in a lecture video is an important limitation of this format. This paper introduces visual summarization of lecture video segments to enhance navigation. A lecture video is divided into segments based on the frame-to-frame similarity of content. The user navigates the lecture video content by viewing a single frame visual and textual summary of each segment. The paper presents a novel methodology to generate the visual summary of a lecture video segment by computing similarities between images extracted from the segment and employing a graph-based algorithm to identify the subset of most representative images. The results from this research are integrated into a real-world lecture video management portal called Videopoints. To collect ground truth for evaluation, a survey was conducted where multiple users manually provided visual summaries for 40 lecture video segments. The users also stated whether any images were not selected for the summary because they were similar to other selected images. The graph based algorithm for identifying summary images achieves 78% precision and 72% F1-measure with frequently selected images as the ground truth, and 94% precision and 72% F1-measure with the union of all user selected images as the ground truth. For 98% of algorithm selected visual summary images, at least one user also selected that image for their summary or considered it similar to another image they selected. Over 65% of automatically generated summaries were rated as good or very good by the users on a 4-point scale from poor to very good. Overall, the results establish that the methodology introduced in this paper produces good quality visual summaries that are practically useful for lecture video navigation.      
### 29.Assessing Intelligence in Artificial Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02909.pdf)
>  The purpose of this work was to develop of metrics to assess network architectures that balance neural network size and task performance. To this end, the concept of neural efficiency is introduced to measure neural layer utilization, and a second metric called artificial intelligence quotient (aIQ) was created to balance neural network performance and neural network efficiency. To study aIQ and neural efficiency, two simple neural networks were trained on MNIST: a fully connected network (LeNet-300-100) and a convolutional neural network (LeNet-5). The LeNet-5 network with the highest aIQ was 2.32% less accurate but contained 30,912 times fewer parameters than the highest accuracy network. Both batch normalization and dropout layers were found to increase neural efficiency. Finally, high aIQ networks are shown to be memorization and overtraining resistant, capable of learning proper digit classification with an accuracy of 92.51% even when 75% of the class labels are randomized. These results demonstrate the utility of aIQ and neural efficiency as metrics for balancing network performance and size.      
### 30.A Polynomial Neural network with Controllable Precision and Human-Readable Topology II: Accelerated Approach Based on Expanded Layer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02901.pdf)
>  How about converting Taylor series to a network to solve the black-box nature of Neural Networks? Controllable and readable polynomial neural network (Gang transform or CR-PNN) is the Taylor expansion in the form of network, which is about ten times more efficient than typical BPNN for forward-propagation. Additionally, we can control the approximation precision and explain the internal structure of the network; thus, it is used for prediction and system identification. However, as the network depth increases, the computational complexity increases. Here, we presented an accelerated method based on an expanded order to optimize CR-PNN. The running speed of the structure of CR-PNN II is significantly higher than CR-PNN I under preserving the properties of CR-PNN I.      
### 31.Pathological myopia classification with simultaneous lesion segmentation using deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02813.pdf)
>  This investigation reports on the results of convolutional neural networks developed for the recently introduced PathologicAL Myopia (PALM) dataset, which consists of 1200 fundus images. We propose a new Optic Nerve Head (ONH)-based prediction enhancement for the segmentation of atrophy and fovea. Models trained with 400 available training images achieved an AUC of 0.9867 for pathological myopia classification, and a Euclidean distance of 58.27 pixels on the fovea localization task, evaluated on a test set of 400 images. Dice and F1 metrics for semantic segmentation of lesions scored 0.9303 and 0.9869 on optic disc, 0.8001 and 0.9135 on retinal atrophy, and 0.8073 and 0.7059 on retinal detachment, respectively. Our work was acknowledged with an award in the context of the "PathologicAL Myopia detection from retinal images" challenge held during the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (April 2019). Considering that (pathological) myopia cases are often identified as false positives and negatives in classification systems for glaucoma, we envision that the current work could aid in future research to discriminate between glaucomatous and highly-myopic eyes, complemented by the localization and segmentation of landmarks such as fovea, optic disc and atrophy.      
### 32.Overcoming Overfitting and Large Weight Update Problem in Linear Rectifiers: Thresholded Exponential Rectified Linear Units  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02797.pdf)
>  In past few years, linear rectified unit activation functions have shown its significance in the neural networks, surpassing the performance of sigmoid activations. RELU (Nair &amp; Hinton, 2010), ELU (Clevert et al., 2015), PRELU (He et al., 2015), LRELU (Maas et al., 2013), SRELU (Jin et al., 2016), ThresholdedRELU, all these linear rectified activation functions have its own significance over others in some aspect. Most of the time these activation functions suffer from bias shift problem due to non-zero output mean, and high weight update problem in deep complex networks due to unit gradient, which results in slower training, and high variance in model prediction respectively. In this paper, we propose, "Thresholded exponential rectified linear unit" (TERELU) activation function that works better in alleviating in overfitting: large weight update problem. Along with alleviating overfitting problem, this method also gives good amount of non-linearity as compared to other linear rectifiers. We will show better performance on the various datasets using neural networks, considering TERELU activation method compared to other activations.      
### 33.Uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation with Normalizing Flows  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02683.pdf)
>  Medical image segmentation is inherently an ambiguous task due to factors such as partial volumes and variations in anatomical definitions. While in most cases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of interest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to inferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on input images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such distributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability scores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is based on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase the expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after the encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior distribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations. With this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our conditional generative model is enhanced. Performance of our model, which we call cFlow Net, is evaluated on two medical imaging datasets demonstrating substantial improvements in both qualitative and quantitative measures when compared to a recent cVAE based model.      
### 34.Deep Sequential Feature Learning in Clinical Image Classification of Infectious Keratitis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02666.pdf)
>  Infectious keratitis is the most common entities of corneal diseases, in which pathogen grows in the cornea leading to inflammation and destruction of the corneal tissues. Infectious keratitis is a medical emergency, for which a rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed for speedy initiation of prompt and precise treatment to halt the disease progress and to limit the extent of corneal damage; otherwise it may develop sight-threatening and even eye-globe-threatening condition. In this paper, we propose a sequential-level deep learning model to effectively discriminate the distinction and subtlety of infectious corneal disease via the classification of clinical images. In this approach, we devise an appropriate mechanism to preserve the spatial structures of clinical images and disentangle the informative features for clinical image classification of infectious keratitis. In competition with 421 ophthalmologists, the performance of the proposed sequential-level deep model achieved 80.00% diagnostic accuracy, far better than the 49.27% diagnostic accuracy achieved by ophthalmologists over 120 test images.      
### 35.M3P: Learning Universal Representations via Multitask Multilingual Multimodal Pre-training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02635.pdf)
>  This paper presents a Multitask Multilingual Multimodal Pre-trained model (M3P) that combines multilingual-monomodal pre-training and monolingual-multimodal pre-training into a unified framework via multitask learning and weight sharing. The model learns universal representations that can map objects that occurred in different modalities or expressed in different languages to vectors in a common semantic space. To verify the generalization capability of M3P, we fine-tune the pre-trained model for different types of downstream tasks: multilingual image-text retrieval, multilingual image captioning, multimodal machine translation, multilingual natural language inference and multilingual text generation. Evaluation shows that M3P can (i) achieve comparable results on multilingual tasks and English multimodal tasks, compared to the state-of-the-art models pre-trained for these two types of tasks separately, and (ii) obtain new state-of-the-art results on non-English multimodal tasks in the zero-shot or few-shot setting. We also build a new Multilingual Image-Language Dataset (MILD) by collecting large amounts of (text-query, image, context) triplets in 8 languages from the logs of a commercial search engine      
### 36.Robust Automatic Whole Brain Extraction on Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Brain Tumor Patients using Dense-Vnet  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02627.pdf)
>  Whole brain extraction, also known as skull stripping, is a process in neuroimaging in which non-brain tissue such as skull, eyeballs, skin, etc. are removed from neuroimages. Skull striping is a preliminary step in presurgical planning, cortical reconstruction, and automatic tumor segmentation. Despite a plethora of skull stripping approaches in the literature, few are sufficiently accurate for processing pathology-presenting MRIs, especially MRIs with brain tumors. In this work we propose a deep learning approach for skull striping common MRI sequences in oncology such as T1-weighted with gadolinium contrast (T1Gd) and T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) in patients with brain tumors. We automatically created gray matter, white matter, and CSF probability masks using SPM12 software and merged the masks into one for a final whole-brain mask for model training. Dice agreement, sensitivity, and specificity of the model (referred herein as DeepBrain) was tested against manual brain masks. To assess data efficiency, we retrained our models using progressively fewer training data examples and calculated average dice scores on the test set for the models trained in each round. Further, we tested our model against MRI of healthy brains from the LBP40A dataset. Overall, DeepBrain yielded an average dice score of 94.5%, sensitivity of 96.4%, and specificity of 98.5% on brain tumor data. For healthy brains, model performance improved to a dice score of 96.2%, sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 99.2%. The data efficiency experiment showed that, for this specific task, comparable levels of accuracy could have been achieved with as few as 50 training samples. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a deep learning model trained on minimally processed automatically-generated labels can generate more accurate brain masks on MRI of brain tumor patients within seconds.      
### 37.Image Augmentations for GAN Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02595.pdf)
>  Data augmentations have been widely studied to improve the accuracy and robustness of classifiers. However, the potential of image augmentation in improving GAN models for image synthesis has not been thoroughly investigated in previous studies. In this work, we systematically study the effectiveness of various existing augmentation techniques for GAN training in a variety of settings. We provide insights and guidelines on how to augment images for both vanilla GANs and GANs with regularizations, improving the fidelity of the generated images substantially. Surprisingly, we find that vanilla GANs attain generation quality on par with recent state-of-the-art results if we use augmentations on both real and generated images. When this GAN training is combined with other augmentation-based regularization techniques, such as contrastive loss and consistency regularization, the augmentations further improve the quality of generated images. We provide new state-of-the-art results for conditional generation on CIFAR-10 with both consistency loss and contrastive loss as additional regularizations.      
### 38.DFR-TSD: A Deep Learning Based Framework for Robust Traffic Sign Detection Under Challenging Weather Conditions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02578.pdf)
>  Robust traffic sign detection and recognition (TSDR) is of paramount importance for the successful realization of autonomous vehicle technology. The importance of this task has led to a vast amount of research efforts and many promising methods have been proposed in the existing literature. However, the SOTA (SOTA) methods have been evaluated on clean and challenge-free datasets and overlooked the performance deterioration associated with different challenging conditions (CCs) that obscure the traffic images captured in the wild. In this paper, we look at the TSDR problem under CCs and focus on the performance degradation associated with them. To overcome this, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based TSDR framework with prior enhancement. Our modular approach consists of a CNN-based challenge classifier, Enhance-Net, an encoder-decoder CNN architecture for image enhancement, and two separate CNN architectures for sign-detection and classification. We propose a novel training pipeline for Enhance-Net that focuses on the enhancement of the traffic sign regions (instead of the whole image) in the challenging images subject to their accurate detection. We used CURE-TSD dataset consisting of traffic videos captured under different CCs to evaluate the efficacy of our approach. We experimentally show that our method obtains an overall precision and recall of 91.1% and 70.71% that is 7.58% and 35.90% improvement in precision and recall, respectively, compared to the current benchmark. Furthermore, we compare our approach with SOTA object detection networks, Faster-RCNN and R-FCN, and show that our approach outperforms them by a large margin.      
### 39.Exploration of Interpretability Techniques for Deep COVID-19 Classification using Chest X-ray Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02570.pdf)
>  The outbreak of COVID-19 has shocked the entire world with its fairly rapid spread and has challenged different sectors. One of the most effective ways to limit its spread is the early and accurate diagnosis of infected patients. Medical imaging such as X-ray and Computed Tomography (CT) combined with the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an essential role in supporting the medical staff in the diagnosis process. Thereby, the use of five different deep learning models (ResNet18, ResNet34, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, and DenseNet161) and their Ensemble have been used in this paper, to classify COVID-19, pneumoniæ and healthy subjects using Chest X-Ray. Multi-label classification was performed to predict multiple pathologies for each patient, if present. Foremost, the interpretability of each of the networks was thoroughly studied using techniques like occlusion, saliency, input X gradient, guided backpropagation, integrated gradients, and DeepLIFT. The mean Micro-F1 score of the models for COVID-19 classifications ranges from 0.66 to 0.875, and is 0.89 for the Ensemble of the network models. The qualitative results depicted the ResNets to be the most interpretable model.      
### 40.Automated segmentation of retinal fluid volumes from structural and angiographic optical coherence tomography using deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02569.pdf)
>  Purpose: We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), named Retinal Fluid Segmentation Network (ReF-Net) to segment volumetric retinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume. Methods: 3 x 3-mm OCT scans were acquired on one eye by a 70-kHz OCT commercial AngioVue system (RTVue-XR; Optovue, Inc.) from 51 participants in a clinical diabetic retinopathy (DR) study (45 with retinal edema and 6 healthy controls). A CNN with U-Net-like architecture was constructed to detect and segment the retinal fluid. Cross-sectional OCT and angiography (OCTA) scans were used for training and testing ReF-Net. The effect of including OCTA data for retinal fluid segmentation was investigated in this study. Volumetric retinal fluid can be constructed using the output of ReF-Net. Area-under-Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-curve (AROC), intersection-over-union (IoU), and F1-score were calculated to evaluate the performance of ReF-Net. Results: ReF-Net shows high accuracy (F1 = 0.864 +/- 0.084) in retinal fluid segmentation. The performance can be further improved (F1 = 0.892 +/- 0.038) by including information from both OCTA and structural OCT. ReF-Net also shows strong robustness to shadow artifacts. Volumetric retinal fluid can provide more comprehensive information than the 2D area, whether cross-sectional or en face projections. Conclusions: A deep-learning-based method can accurately segment retinal fluid volumetrically on OCT/OCTA scans with strong robustness to shadow artifacts. OCTA data can improve retinal fluid segmentation. Volumetric representations of retinal fluid are superior to 2D projections. Translational Relevance: Using a deep learning method to segment retinal fluid volumetrically has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of diabetic macular edema by OCT systems.
