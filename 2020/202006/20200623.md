### 1.DiRS: On Creating Benchmark Datasets for Remote Sensing Image Interpretation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12485.pdf)
>  The past decade has witnessed great progress on remote sensing (RS) image interpretation and its wide applications. With RS images becoming more accessible than ever before, there is an increasing demand for the automatic interpretation of these images, where benchmark datasets are essential prerequisites for developing and testing intelligent interpretation algorithms. After reviewing existing benchmark datasets in the research community of RS image interpretation, this article discusses the problem of how to efficiently prepare a suitable benchmark dataset for RS image analysis. Specifically, we first analyze the current challenges of developing intelligent algorithms for RS image interpretation with bibliometric investigations. We then present some principles, i.e., diversity, richness, and scalability (called DiRS), on constructing benchmark datasets in efficient manners. Following the DiRS principles, we also provide an example on building datasets for RS image classification, i.e., Million-AID, a new large-scale benchmark dataset containing million instances for RS scene classification. Several challenges and perspectives in RS image annotation are finally discussed to facilitate the research in benchmark dataset construction. We do hope this paper will provide RS community an overall perspective on constructing large-scale and practical image datasets for further research, especially data-driven ones.      
### 2.Self-supervised Video Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12480.pdf)
>  The objective of this paper is self-supervised representation learning, with the goal of solving semi-supervised video object segmentation (a.k.a. dense tracking). We make the following contributions: (i) we propose to improve the existing self-supervised approach, with a simple, yet more effective memory mechanism for long-term correspondence matching, which resolves the challenge caused by the dis-appearance and reappearance of objects; (ii) by augmenting the self-supervised approach with an online adaptation module, our method successfully alleviates tracker drifts caused by spatial-temporal discontinuity, e.g. occlusions or dis-occlusions, fast motions; (iii) we explore the efficiency of self-supervised representation learning for dense tracking, surprisingly, we show that a powerful tracking model can be trained with as few as 100 raw video clips (equivalent to a duration of 11mins), indicating that low-level statistics have already been effective for tracking tasks; (iv) we demonstrate state-of-the-art results among the self-supervised approaches on DAVIS-2017 and YouTube-VOS, as well as surpassing most of methods trained with millions of manual segmentation annotations, further bridging the gap between self-supervised and supervised learning. Codes are released to foster any further research (<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/fangruizhu/self_sup_semiVOS" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>).      
### 3.Slimming Neural Networks using Adaptive Connectivity Scores  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12463.pdf)
>  There are two broad approaches to deep neural network (DNN) pruning: 1) apply-ing a deterministic constraint on the weight matrices, which takes advantage of their ease of implementation and the learned structures of the weight matrix, and 2) using a probabilistic framework aimed at maintaining the flow of information between layers, which leverages the connections between filters and their downstream impact. Each approach's advantage supplements the missing portions of the alternate approach yet no one has combined and fully capitalized on both of them. Further,there are some common practical issues that affect both, e.g., intense manual effort to analyze sensitivity and set the upper pruning limits of layers. In this work,we propose Slimming Neural networks using Adaptive Connectivity Measures(SNACS), as an algorithm that uses a probabilistic framework for compression while incorporating weight-based constraints at multiple levels to capitalize on both their strengths and overcome previous issues. We propose a hash-based estimator of Adaptive Conditional Mutual Information(ACMI) to evaluate the connectivity between filters of different layers, which includes a magnitude-based scaling criteria that leverages weight matrices. To reduce the amount of unnecessary manual effort required to set the upper pruning limit of different layers in a DNN we propose a set of operating constraints to help automatically set them. Further, we take extended advantage of weight matrices by defining a sensitivity criteria for filters that measures the strength of their contributions to the following layer and highlights critical filters that need to be protected from pruning. We show that our proposed approach is faster by over 17x the nearest comparable method and outperforms all existing pruning approaches on three standard Dataset-DNN benchmarks: CIFAR10-VGG16, CIFAR10-ResNet56 and ILSVRC2012-ResNet50.      
### 4.A Baseline Approach for AutoImplant: the MICCAI 2020 Cranial Implant Design Challenge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12449.pdf)
>  In this study, we present a baseline approach for AutoImplant (<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://autoimplant.grand-challenge.org/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>) - the cranial implant design challenge, which, as suggested by the organizers, can be formulated as a volumetric shape learning task. In this task, the defective skull, the complete skull and the cranial implant are represented as binary voxel grids. To accomplish this task, the implant can be either reconstructed directly from the defective skull or obtained by taking the difference between a defective skull and a complete skull. In the latter case, a complete skull has to be reconstructed given a defective skull, which defines a volumetric shape completion problem. Our baseline approach for this task is based on the former formulation, i.e., a deep neural network is trained to predict the implants directly from the defective skulls. The approach generates high-quality implants in two steps: First, an encoder-decoder network learns a coarse representation of the implant from down-sampled, defective skulls; The coarse implant is only used to generate the bounding box of the defected region in the original high-resolution skull. Second, another encoder-decoder network is trained to generate a fine implant from the bounded area. On the test set, the proposed approach achieves an average dice similarity score (DSC) of 0.8555 and Hausdorff distance (HD) of 5.1825 mm. The code is publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Jianningli/autoimplant" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 5.Unsupervised Learning of Global Registration of Temporal Sequence of Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12378.pdf)
>  Global registration of point clouds aims to find an optimal alignment of a sequence of 2D or 3D point sets. In this paper, we present a novel method that takes advantage of current deep learning techniques for unsupervised learning of global registration from a temporal sequence of point clouds. Our key novelty is that we introduce a deep Spatio-Temporal REPresentation (STREP) feature, which describes the geometric essence of both temporal and spatial relationship of the sequence of point clouds acquired with sensors in an unknown environment. In contrast to the previous practice that treats each time step (pair-wise registration) individually, our unsupervised model starts with optimizing a sequence of latent STREP feature, which is then decoded to a temporally and spatially continuous sequence of geometric transformations to globally align multiple point clouds. We have evaluated our proposed approach over both simulated 2D and real 3D datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can beat other techniques by taking into account the temporal information in deep feature learning.      
### 6.Learning Physical Graph Representations from Visual Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12373.pdf)
>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proved exceptional at learning representations for visual object categorization. However, CNNs do not explicitly encode objects, parts, and their physical properties, which has limited CNNs' success on tasks that require structured understanding of visual scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the idea of Physical Scene Graphs (PSGs), which represent scenes as hierarchical graphs, with nodes in the hierarchy corresponding intuitively to object parts at different scales, and edges to physical connections between parts. Bound to each node is a vector of latent attributes that intuitively represent object properties such as surface shape and texture. We also describe PSGNet, a network architecture that learns to extract PSGs by reconstructing scenes through a PSG-structured bottleneck. PSGNet augments standard CNNs by including: recurrent feedback connections to combine low and high-level image information; graph pooling and vectorization operations that convert spatially-uniform feature maps into object-centric graph structures; and perceptual grouping principles to encourage the identification of meaningful scene elements. We show that PSGNet outperforms alternative self-supervised scene representation algorithms at scene segmentation tasks, especially on complex real-world images, and generalizes well to unseen object types and scene arrangements. PSGNet is also able learn from physical motion, enhancing scene estimates even for static images. We present a series of ablation studies illustrating the importance of each component of the PSGNet architecture, analyses showing that learned latent attributes capture intuitive scene properties, and illustrate the use of PSGs for compositional scene inference.      
### 7.Generative Sparse Detection Networks for 3D Single-shot Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12356.pdf)
>  3D object detection has been widely studied due to its potential applicability to many promising areas such as robotics and augmented reality. Yet, the sparse nature of the 3D data poses unique challenges to this task. Most notably, the observable surface of the 3D point clouds is disjoint from the center of the instance to ground the bounding box prediction on. To this end, we propose Generative Sparse Detection Network (GSDN), a fully-convolutional single-shot sparse detection network that efficiently generates the support for object proposals. The key component of our model is a generative sparse tensor decoder, which uses a series of transposed convolutions and pruning layers to expand the support of sparse tensors while discarding unlikely object centers to maintain minimal runtime and memory footprint. GSDN can process unprecedentedly large-scale inputs with a single fully-convolutional feed-forward pass, thus does not require the heuristic post-processing stage that stitches results from sliding windows as other previous methods have. We validate our approach on three 3D indoor datasets including the large-scale 3D indoor reconstruction dataset where our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a relative improvement of 7.14% while being 3.78 times faster than the best prior work.      
### 8.On the Ability of a CNN to Realize Image-to-Image Language Conversion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12316.pdf)
>  The purpose of this paper is to reveal the ability that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have on the novel task of image-to-image language conversion. We propose a new network to tackle this task by converting images of Korean Hangul characters directly into images of the phonetic Latin character equivalent. The conversion rules between Hangul and the phonetic symbols are not explicitly provided. The results of the proposed network show that it is possible to perform image-to-image language conversion. Moreover, it shows that it can grasp the structural features of Hangul even from limited learning data. In addition, it introduces a new network to use when the input and output have significantly different features.      
### 9.Human-Expert-Level Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning with Data Distillation and Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12285.pdf)
>  The application of Deep Learning (DL) for medical diagnosis is often hampered by two problems. First, the amount of training data may be scarce, as it is limited by the number of patients who have acquired the condition to be diagnosed. Second, the training data may be corrupted by various types of noise. Here, we study the problem of brain tumor detection from magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) data, where both types of problems are prominent. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method for training a deep neural network that distills particularly representative training examples and augments the training data by mixing these samples from one class with those from the same and other classes to create additional training samples. We demonstrate that this technique substantially improves performance, allowing our method to reach human-expert-level accuracy with just a few thousand training examples. Interestingly, the network learns to rely on features of the data that are usually ignored by human experts, suggesting new directions for future research.      
### 10.FDFlowNet: Fast Optical Flow Estimation using a Deep Lightweight Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12263.pdf)
>  Significant progress has been made for estimating optical flow using deep neural networks. Advanced deep models achieve accurate flow estimation often with a considerable computation complexity and time-consuming training processes. In this work, we present a lightweight yet effective model for real-time optical flow estimation, termed FDFlowNet (fast deep flownet). We achieve better or similar accuracy on the challenging KITTI and Sintel benchmarks while being about 2 times faster than PWC-Net. This is achieved by a carefully-designed structure and newly proposed components. We first introduce an U-shape network for constructing multi-scale feature which benefits upper levels with global receptive field compared with pyramid network. In each scale, a partial fully connected structure with dilated convolution is proposed for flow estimation that obtains a good balance among speed, accuracy and number of parameters compared with sequential connected and dense connected structures. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance while being fast and lightweight.      
### 11.Pix2Vox++: Multi-scale Context-aware 3D Object Reconstruction from Single and Multiple Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12250.pdf)
>  Recovering the 3D shape of an object from single or multiple images with deep neural networks has been attracting increasing attention in the past few years. Mainstream works (e.g. 3D-R2N2) use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to sequentially fuse feature maps of input images. However, RNN-based approaches are unable to produce consistent reconstruction results when given the same input images with different orders. Moreover, RNNs may forget important features from early input images due to long-term memory loss. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for single-view and multi-view 3D object reconstruction, named Pix2Vox++. By using a well-designed encoder-decoder, it generates a coarse 3D volume from each input image. A multi-scale context-aware fusion module is then introduced to adaptively select high-quality reconstructions for different parts from all coarse 3D volumes to obtain a fused 3D volume. To further correct the wrongly recovered parts in the fused 3D volume, a refiner is adopted to generate the final output. Experimental results on the ShapeNet, Pix3D, and Things3D benchmarks show that Pix2Vox++ performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.      
### 12.Disrupting Deepfakes with an Adversarial Attack that Survives Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12247.pdf)
>  The rapid progress in generative models and autoencoders has given rise to effective video tampering techniques, used for generating deepfakes. Mitigation research is mostly focused on post-factum deepfake detection and not prevention. We complement these efforts by proposing a prevention technique against face-swapping autoencoders. Our technique consists of a novel training-resistant adversarial attack that can be applied to a video to disrupt face-swapping manipulations. Our attack introduces spatial-temporal distortions to the output of the face-swapping autoencoders, and it holds whether or not our adversarial images have been included in the training set of said autoencoders. To implement the attack, we construct a bilevel optimization problem, where we train a generator and a face-swapping model instance against each other. Specifically, we pair each input image with a target distortion, and feed them into a generator that produces an adversarial image. This image will exhibit the distortion when a face-swapping autoencoder is applied to it. We solve the optimization problem by training the generator and the face-swapping model simultaneously using an iterative process of alternating optimization. Finally, we validate our attack using a popular implementation of FaceSwap, and show that our attack transfers across different models and target faces. More broadly, these results demonstrate the existence of training-resistant adversarial attacks, potentially applicable to a wide range of domains.      
### 13.Pain Intensity Estimation from Mobile Video Using 2D and 3D Facial Keypoints  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12246.pdf)
>  Managing post-surgical pain is critical for successful surgical outcomes. One of the challenges of pain management is accurately assessing the pain level of patients. Self-reported numeric pain ratings are limited because they are subjective, can be affected by mood, and can influence the patient's perception of pain when making comparisons. In this paper, we introduce an approach that analyzes 2D and 3D facial keypoints of post-surgical patients to estimate their pain intensity level. Our approach leverages the previously unexplored capabilities of a smartphone to capture a dense 3D representation of a person's face as input for pain intensity level estimation. Our contributions are adata collection study with post-surgical patients to collect ground-truth labeled sequences of 2D and 3D facial keypoints for developing a pain estimation algorithm, a pain estimation model that uses multiple instance learning to overcome inherent limitations in facial keypoint sequences, and the preliminary results of the pain estimation model using 2D and 3D features with comparisons of alternate approaches.      
### 14.Improving Few-Shot Visual Classification with Unlabelled Examples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12245.pdf)
>  We propose a transductive meta-learning method that uses unlabelled instances to improve few-shot image classification performance. Our approach combines a regularized Mahalanobis-distance-based soft k-means clustering procedure with a state of the art neural adaptive feature extractor to achieve improved test-time classification accuracy using unlabelled data. We evaluate our method on transductive few-shot learning tasks, in which the goal is to jointly predict labels for query (test) examples given a set of support (training) examples. We achieve new state of the art in-domain performance on Meta-Dataset, and improve accuracy on mini- and tiered-ImageNet as compared to other conditional neural adaptive methods that use the same pre-trained feature extractor.      
### 15.ResFPN: Residual Skip Connections in Multi-Resolution Feature Pyramid Networks for Accurate Dense Pixel Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12235.pdf)
>  Dense pixel matching is required for many computer vision algorithms such as disparity, optical flow or scene flow estimation. Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) have proven to be a suitable feature extractor for CNN-based dense matching tasks. FPN generates well localized and semantically strong features at multiple scales. However, the generic FPN is not utilizing its full potential, due to its reasonable but limited localization accuracy. Thus, we present ResFPN -- a multi-resolution feature pyramid network with multiple residual skip connections, where at any scale, we leverage the information from higher resolution maps for stronger and better localized features. In our ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel architecture with clearly higher accuracy than FPN. In addition, we verify the superior accuracy of ResFPN in many different pixel matching applications on established datasets like KITTI, Sintel, and FlyingThings3D.      
### 16.Hierarchical Patch VAE-GAN: Generating Diverse Videos from a Single Sample  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12226.pdf)
>  We consider the task of generating diverse and novel videos from a single video sample. Recently, new hierarchical patch-GAN based approaches were proposed for generating diverse images, given only a single sample at training time. Moving to videos, these approaches fail to generate diverse samples, and often collapse into generating samples similar to the training video. We introduce a novel patch-based variational autoencoder (VAE) which allows for a much greater diversity in generation. Using this tool, a new hierarchical video generation scheme is constructed: at coarse scales, our patch-VAE is employed, ensuring samples are of high diversity. Subsequently, at finer scales, a patch-GAN renders the fine details, resulting in high quality videos. Our experiments show that the proposed method produces diverse samples in both the image domain, and the more challenging video domain.      
### 17.Facial Expression Editing with Continuous Emotion Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12210.pdf)
>  Recently deep generative models have achieved impressive results in the field of automated facial expression editing. However, the approaches presented so far presume a discrete representation of human emotions and are therefore limited in the modelling of non-discrete emotional expressions. To overcome this limitation, we explore how continuous emotion representations can be used to control automated expression editing. We propose a deep generative model that can be used to manipulate facial expressions in facial images according to continuous two-dimensional emotion labels. One dimension represents an emotion's valence, the other represents its degree of arousal. We demonstrate the functionality of our model with a quantitative analysis using classifier networks as well as with a qualitative analysis.      
### 18.Text Recognition in Real Scenarios with a Few Labeled Samples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12209.pdf)
>  Scene text recognition (STR) is still a hot research topic in computer vision field due to its various applications. Existing works mainly focus on learning a general model with a huge number of synthetic text images to recognize unconstrained scene texts, and have achieved substantial progress. However, these methods are not quite applicable in many real-world scenarios where 1) high recognition accuracy is required, while 2) labeled samples are lacked. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper proposes a few-shot adversarial sequence domain adaptation (FASDA) approach to build sequence adaptation between the synthetic source domain (with many synthetic labeled samples) and a specific target domain (with only some or a few real labeled samples). This is done by simultaneously learning each character's feature representation with an attention mechanism and establishing the corresponding character-level latent subspace with adversarial learning. Our approach can maximize the character-level confusion between the source domain and the target domain, thus achieves the sequence-level adaptation with even a small number of labeled samples in the target domain. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the finetuning scheme, and obtains comparable performance to the state-of-the-art STR methods.      
### 19.generating annotated high-fidelity images containing multiple coherent objects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12150.pdf)
>  Recent developments related to generative models have made it possible to generate diverse high-fidelity images. In particular, layout-to-image generation models have gained significant attention due to their capability to generate realistic complex images containing distinct objects. These models are generally conditioned on either semantic layouts or textual descriptions. However, unlike natural images, providing auxiliary information can be extremely hard in domains such as biomedical imaging and remote sensing. In this work, we propose a multi-object generation framework that can synthesize images with multiple objects without explicitly requiring their contextual information during the generation process. Based on a vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) backbone, our model learns to preserve spatial coherency within an image as well as semantic coherency between the objects and the background through two powerful autoregressive priors: PixelSNAIL and LayoutPixelSNAIL. While the PixelSNAIL learns the distribution of the latent encodings of the VQ-VAE, the LayoutPixelSNAIL is used to specifically learn the semantic distribution of the objects. An implicit advantage of our approach is that the generated samples are accompanied by object-level annotations. We demonstrate how coherency and fidelity are preserved with our method through experiments on the Multi-MNIST and CLEVR datasets; thereby outperforming state-of-the-art multi-object generative methods. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through application on medical imaging datasets, where we show that augmenting the training set with generated samples using our approach improves the performance of existing models.      
### 20.High-Precision Digital Traffic Recording with Multi-LiDAR Infrastructure Sensor Setups  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12140.pdf)
>  Large driving datasets are a key component in the current development and safeguarding of automated driving functions. Various methods can be used to collect such driving data records. In addition to the use of sensor equipped research vehicles or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the use of infrastructure sensor technology offers another alternative. To minimize object occlusion during data collection, it is crucial to record the traffic situation from several perspectives in parallel. A fusion of all raw sensor data might create better conditions for multi-object detection and tracking (MODT) compared to the use of individual raw sensor data. So far, no sufficient studies have been conducted to sufficiently confirm this approach. In our work we investigate the impact of fused LiDAR point clouds compared to single LiDAR point clouds. We model different urban traffic scenarios with up to eight 64-layer LiDARs in simulation and in reality. We then analyze the properties of the resulting point clouds and perform MODT for all emerging traffic participants. The evaluation of the extracted trajectories shows that a fused infrastructure approach significantly increases the tracking results and reaches accuracies within a few centimeters.      
### 21.Supervised dimensionality reduction by a Linear Discriminant Analysis on pre-trained CNN features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12127.pdf)
>  We explore the application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to the features obtained in different layers of pretrained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The advantage of LDA compared to other techniques in dimensionality reduction is that it reduces dimensions while preserving the global structure of data, so distances in the low-dimensional structure found are meaningful. The LDA applied to the CNN features finds that the centroids of classes corresponding to the similar data lay closer than classes corresponding to different data. We applied the method to a modification of the MNIST dataset with ten additional classes, each new class with half of the images from one of the standard ten classes. The method finds the new classes close to the corresponding standard classes we took the data form. We also applied the method to a dataset of images of butterflies to find that related subspecies are found to be close. For both datasets, we find a performance similar to state-of-the-art methods.      
### 22.Automated machine vision enabled detection of movement disorders from hand drawn spirals  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12121.pdf)
>  A widely used test for the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Essential tremor (ET) is hand-drawn shapes,where the analysis is observationally performed by the examining neurologist. This method is subjective and is prone to bias amongst different physicians. Due to the similarities in the symptoms of the two diseases, they are often misdiagnosed.Studies which attempt to automate the process typically use digitized input, where the tablet or specialized equipment are not affordable in many clinical settings. This study uses a dataset of scanned pen and paper drawings and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform classification between PD, ET and control subjects. The discrimination accuracy of PD from controls was 98.2%. The discrimination accuracy of PD from ET and from controls was 92%. An ablation study was conducted and indicated that correct hyper parameter optimization can increases the accuracy up to 4.33%. Finally, the study indicates the viability of using a CNN-enabled machine vision system to provide robust and accurate detection of movement disorders from hand drawn spirals.      
### 23.The color out of space: learning self-supervised representations for Earth Observation imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12119.pdf)
>  The recent growth in the number of satellite images fosters the development of effective deep-learning techniques for Remote Sensing (RS). However, their full potential is untapped due to the lack of large annotated datasets. Such a problem is usually countered by fine-tuning a feature extractor that is previously trained on the ImageNet dataset. Unfortunately, the domain of natural images differs from the RS one, which hinders the final performance. In this work, we propose to learn meaningful representations from satellite imagery, leveraging its high-dimensionality spectral bands to reconstruct the visible colors. We conduct experiments on land cover classification (BigEarthNet) and West Nile Virus detection, showing that colorization is a solid pretext task for training a feature extractor. Furthermore, we qualitatively observe that guesses based on natural images and colorization rely on different parts of the input. This paves the way to an ensemble model that eventually outperforms both the above-mentioned techniques.      
### 24.Progressive Graph Learning for Open-Set Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12087.pdf)
>  Domain shift is a fundamental problem in visual recognition which typically arises when the source and target data follow different distributions. The existing domain adaptation approaches which tackle this problem work in the closed-set setting with the assumption that the source and the target data share exactly the same classes of objects. In this paper, we tackle a more realistic problem of open-set domain shift where the target data contains additional classes that are not present in the source data. More specifically, we introduce an end-to-end Progressive Graph Learning (PGL) framework where a graph neural network with episodic training is integrated to suppress underlying conditional shift and adversarial learning is adopted to close the gap between the source and target distributions. Compared to the existing open-set adaptation approaches, our approach guarantees to achieve a tighter upper bound of the target error. Extensive experiments on three standard open-set benchmarks evidence that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in open-set domain adaptation.      
### 25.Split to Be Slim: An Overlooked Redundancy in Vanilla Convolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12085.pdf)
>  Many effective solutions have been proposed to reduce the redundancy of models for inference acceleration. Nevertheless, common approaches mostly focus on eliminating less important filters or constructing efficient operations, while ignoring the pattern redundancy in feature maps. We reveal that many feature maps within a layer share similar but not identical patterns. However, it is difficult to identify if features with similar patterns are redundant or contain essential details. Therefore, instead of directly removing uncertain redundant features, we propose a \textbf{sp}lit based \textbf{conv}olutional operation, namely SPConv, to tolerate features with similar patterns but require less computation. Specifically, we split input feature maps into the representative part and the uncertain redundant part, where intrinsic information is extracted from the representative part through relatively heavy computation while tiny hidden details in the uncertain redundant part are processed with some light-weight operation. To recalibrate and fuse these two groups of processed features, we propose a parameters-free feature fusion module. Moreover, our SPConv is formulated to replace the vanilla convolution in a plug-and-play way. Without any bells and whistles, experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate SPConv-equipped networks consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and inference time on GPU, with FLOPs and parameters dropped sharply.      
### 26.MotioNet: 3D Human Motion Reconstruction from Monocular Video with Skeleton Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12075.pdf)
>  We introduce MotioNet, a deep neural network that directly reconstructs the motion of a 3D human skeleton from monocular video.While previous methods rely on either rigging or inverse kinematics (IK) to associate a consistent skeleton with temporally coherent joint rotations, our method is the first data-driven approach that directly outputs a kinematic skeleton, which is a complete, commonly used, motion representation. At the crux of our approach lies a deep neural network with embedded kinematic priors, which decomposes sequences of 2D joint positions into two separate attributes: a single, symmetric, skeleton, encoded by bone lengths, and a sequence of 3D joint rotations associated with global root positions and foot contact labels. These attributes are fed into an integrated forward kinematics (FK) layer that outputs 3D positions, which are compared to a ground truth. In addition, an adversarial loss is applied to the velocities of the recovered rotations, to ensure that they lie on the manifold of natural joint rotations. The key advantage of our approach is that it learns to infer natural joint rotations directly from the training data, rather than assuming an underlying model, or inferring them from joint positions using a data-agnostic IK solver. We show that enforcing a single consistent skeleton along with temporally coherent joint rotations constrains the solution space, leading to a more robust handling of self-occlusions and depth ambiguities.      
### 27.Object Tracking through Residual and Dense LSTMs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12061.pdf)
>  Visual object tracking task is constantly gaining importance in several fields of application as traffic monitoring, robotics, and surveillance, to name a few. Dealing with changes in the appearance of the tracked object is paramount to achieve high tracking accuracy, and is usually achieved by continually learning features. Recently, deep learning-based trackers based on LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) recurrent neural networks have emerged as a powerful alternative, bypassing the need to retrain the feature extraction in an online fashion. Inspired by the success of residual and dense networks in image recognition, we propose here to enhance the capabilities of hybrid trackers using residual and/or dense LSTMs. By introducing skip connections, it is possible to increase the depth of the architecture while ensuring a fast convergence. Experimental results on the Re3 tracker show that DenseLSTMs outperform Residual and regular LSTM, and offer a higher resilience to nuisances such as occlusions and out-of-view objects. Our case study supports the adoption of residual-based RNNs for enhancing the robustness of other trackers.      
### 28.Differentiable Rendering: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12057.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable performance improvements on vision-related tasks such as object detection or image segmentation. Despite their success, they generally lack the understanding of 3D objects which form the image, as it is not always possible to collect 3D information about the scene or to easily annotate it. Differentiable rendering is a novel field which allows the gradients of 3D objects to be calculated and propagated through images. It also reduces the requirement of 3D data collection and annotation, while enabling higher success rate in various applications. This paper reviews existing literature and discusses the current state of differentiable rendering, its applications and open research problems.      
### 29.Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12052.pdf)
>  Many existing approaches for point cloud semantic segmentation are strongly supervised. These strongly supervised approaches heavily rely on a large amount of labeled training data that is difficult to obtain and suffer from poor generalization to new classes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel attention-aware multi-prototype transductive few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation method to segment new classes given a few labeled examples. Specifically, each class is represented by multiple prototypes to model the complex data distribution of 3D point clouds. Subsequently, we employ a transductive label propagation method to exploit the affinities between labeled multi-prototypes and unlabeled query points, and among the unlabeled query points. Furthermore, we design an attention-aware multi-level feature learning network to learn the discriminative features that capture the semantic correlations and geometric dependencies between points. Our proposed method shows a significant improvement compared to the baselines for few-shot point cloud segmentation on unseen classes in two benchmark datasets.      
### 30.Characterizing Hirability via Personality and Behavior  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12041.pdf)
>  While personality traits have been extensively modeled as behavioral constructs, we model \textbf{\textit{job hirability}} as a \emph{personality construct}. On the {\emph{First Impressions Candidate Screening}} (FICS) dataset, we examine relationships among personality and hirability measures. Modeling hirability as a discrete/continuous variable with the \emph{big-five} personality traits as predictors, we utilize (a) apparent personality annotations, and (b) personality estimates obtained via audio, visual and textual cues for hirability prediction (HP). We also examine the efficacy of a two-step HP process involving (1) personality estimation from multimodal behavioral cues, followed by (2) HP from personality estimates. <br>Interesting results from experiments performed on $\approx$~5000 FICS videos are as follows. (1) For each of the \emph{text}, \emph{audio} and \emph{visual} modalities, HP via the above two-step process is more effective than directly predicting from behavioral cues. Superior results are achieved when hirability is modeled as a continuous vis-á-vis categorical variable. (2) Among visual cues, eye and bodily information achieve performance comparable to face cues for predicting personality and hirability. (3) Explanatory analyses reveal the impact of multimodal behavior on personality impressions; \eg, Conscientiousness impressions are impacted by the use of \emph{cuss words} (verbal behavior), and \emph{eye movements} (non-verbal behavior), confirming prior observations.      
### 31.DO-Conv: Depthwise Over-parameterized Convolutional Layer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12030.pdf)
>  Convolutional layers are the core building blocks of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose to augment a convolutional layer with an additional depthwise convolution, where each input channel is convolved with a different 2D kernel. The composition of the two convolutions constitutes an over-parameterization, since it adds learnable parameters, while the resulting linear operation can be expressed by a single convolution layer. We refer to this depthwise over-parameterized convolutional layer as DO-Conv. We show with extensive experiments that the mere replacement of conventional convolutional layers with DO-Conv layers boosts the performance of CNNs on many classical vision tasks, such as image classification, detection, and segmentation. Moreover, in the inference phase, the depthwise convolution is folded into the conventional convolution, reducing the computation to be exactly equivalent to that of a convolutional layer without over-parameterization. As DO-Conv introduces performance gains without incurring any computational complexity increase for inference, we advocate it as an alternative to the conventional convolutional layer. We open-source a reference implementation of DO-Conv in Tensorflow, PyTorch and GluonCV at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/yangyanli/DO-Conv" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 32.Towards Better Performance and More Explainable Uncertainty for 3D Object Detection of Autonomous Vehicles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12015.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel form of the loss function to increase the performance of LiDAR-based 3d object detection and obtain more explainable and convincing uncertainty for the prediction. The loss function was designed using corner transformation and uncertainty modeling. With the new loss function, the performance of our method on the val split of KITTI dataset shows up to a 15% increase in terms of Average Precision (AP) comparing with the baseline using simple L1 Loss. In the study of the characteristics of predicted uncertainties, we find that generally more accurate prediction of the bounding box is usually accompanied by lower uncertainty. The distribution of corner uncertainties agrees on the distribution of the point cloud in the bounding box, which means the corner with denser observed points has lower uncertainty. Moreover, our method also learns the constraint from the cuboid geometry of the bounding box in uncertainty prediction. Finally, we propose an efficient Bayesian updating method to recover the uncertainty for the original parameters of the bounding boxes which can help to provide probabilistic results for the planning module.      
### 33.Feature Alignment and Restoration for Domain Generalization and Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12009.pdf)
>  For domain generalization (DG) and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), cross domain feature alignment has been widely explored to pull the feature distributions of different domains in order to learn domain-invariant representations. However, the feature alignment is in general task-ignorant and could result in degradation of the discrimination power of the feature representation and thus hinders the high performance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework termed Feature Alignment and Restoration (FAR) to simultaneously ensure high generalization and discrimination power of the networks for effective DG and UDA. Specifically, we perform feature alignment (FA) across domains by aligning the moments of the distributions of attentively selected features to reduce their discrepancy. To ensure high discrimination, we propose a Feature Restoration (FR) operation to distill task-relevant features from the residual information and use them to compensate for the aligned features. For better disentanglement, we enforce a dual ranking entropy loss constraint in the FR step to encourage the separation of task-relevant and task-irrelevant features. Extensive experiments on multiple classification benchmarks demonstrate the high performance and strong generalization of our FAR framework for both domain generalization and unsupervised domain adaptation.      
### 34.MaskIt: Masking for efficient utilization of incomplete public datasets for training deep learning models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12004.pdf)
>  A major challenge in training deep learning models is the lack of high quality and complete datasets. In the paper, we present a masking approach for training deep learning models from a publicly available but incomplete dataset. For example, city of Hamburg, Germany maintains a list of trees along the roads, but this dataset does not contain any information about trees in private homes and parks. To train a deep learning model on such a dataset, we mask the street trees and aerial images with the road network. Road network used for creating the mask is downloaded from OpenStreetMap, and it marks the area where the training data is available. The mask is passed to the model as one of the inputs and it also coats the output. Our model learns to successfully predict trees only in the masked region with 78.4% accuracy.      
### 35.Modeling Lost Information in Lossy Image Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11999.pdf)
>  Lossy image compression is one of the most commonly used operators for digital images. Most recently proposed deep-learning-based image compression methods leverage the auto-encoder structure, and reach a series of promising results in this field. The images are encoded into low dimensional latent features first, and entropy coded subsequently by exploiting the statistical redundancy. However, the information lost during encoding is unfortunately inevitable, which poses a significant challenge to the decoder to reconstruct the original images. In this work, we propose a novel invertible framework called Invertible Lossy Compression (ILC) to largely mitigate the information loss problem. Specifically, ILC introduces an invertible encoding module to replace the encoder-decoder structure to produce the low dimensional informative latent representation, meanwhile, transform the lost information into an auxiliary latent variable that won't be further coded or stored. The latent representation is quantized and encoded into bit-stream, and the latent variable is forced to follow a specified distribution, i.e. isotropic Gaussian distribution. In this way, recovering the original image is made tractable by easily drawing a surrogate latent variable and applying the inverse pass of the module with the sampled variable and decoded latent features. Experimental results demonstrate that with a new component replacing the auto-encoder in image compression methods, ILC can significantly outperform the baseline method on extensive benchmark datasets by combining with the existing compression algorithms.      
### 36.Global Image Sentiment Transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11989.pdf)
>  Transferring the sentiment of an image is an unexplored research topic in the area of computer vision. This work proposes a novel framework consisting of a reference image retrieval step and a global sentiment transfer step to transfer sentiments of images according to a given sentiment tag. The proposed image retrieval algorithm is based on the SSIM index. The retrieved reference images by the proposed algorithm are more content-related against the algorithm based on the perceptual loss. Therefore can lead to a better image sentiment transfer result. In addition, we propose a global sentiment transfer step, which employs an optimization algorithm to iteratively transfer sentiment of images based on feature maps produced by the Densenet121 architecture. The proposed sentiment transfer algorithm can transfer the sentiment of images while ensuring the content structure of the input image intact. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed sentiment transfer framework outperforms existing artistic and photorealistic style transfer algorithms in making reliable sentiment transfer results with rich and exact details.      
### 37.Emerging Biometrics: Deep Inference and Other Computational Intelligence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11971.pdf)
>  This paper aims at identifying emerging computational intelligence trends for the design and modeling of complex biometric-enabled infrastructure and systems. Biometric-enabled systems are evolving towards deep learning and deep inference using the principles of adaptive computing, - the front tides of the modern computational intelligence domain. Therefore, we focus on intelligent inference engines widely deployed in biometrics. Computational intelligence applications that cover a wide spectrum of biometric tasks using physiological and behavioral traits are chosen for illustration. We highlight the technology gaps that must be addressed in future generations of biometric systems. The reported approaches and results primarily address the researchers who work towards developing the next generation of intelligent biometric-enabled systems.      
### 38.Lyric Video Analysis Using Text Detection and Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11933.pdf)
>  We attempt to recognize and track lyric words in lyric videos. Lyric video is a music video showing the lyric words of a song. The main characteristic of lyric videos is that the lyric words are shown at frames synchronously with the music. The difficulty of recognizing and tracking the lyric words is that (1) the words are often decorated and geometrically distorted and (2) the words move arbitrarily and drastically in the video frame. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the motion of the lyric words in lyric videos, as the first step of automatic lyric video generation. In order to analyze the motion of lyric words, we first apply a state-of-the-art scene text detector and recognizer to each video frame. Then, lyric-frame matching is performed to establish the optimal correspondence between lyric words and the frames. After fixing the motion trajectories of individual lyric words from correspondence, we analyze the trajectories of the lyric words by k-medoids clustering and dynamic time warping (DTW).      
### 39.Quickest Intruder Detection for Multiple User Active Authentication  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11921.pdf)
>  In this paper, we investigate how to detect intruders with low latency for Active Authentication (AA) systems with multiple-users. We extend the Quickest Change Detection (QCD) framework to the multiple-user case and formulate the Multiple-user Quickest Intruder Detection (MQID) algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the algorithm to the data-efficient scenario where intruder detection is carried out with fewer observation samples. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two publicly available AA datasets on the face modality.      
### 40.Generalized Zero and Few-Shot Transfer for Facial Forgery Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11863.pdf)
>  We propose Deep Distribution Transfer(DDT), a new transfer learning approach to address the problem of zero and few-shot transfer in the context of facial forgery detection. We examine how well a model (pre-)trained with one forgery creation method generalizes towards a previously unseen manipulation technique or different dataset. To facilitate this transfer, we introduce a new mixture model-based loss formulation that learns a multi-modal distribution, with modes corresponding to class categories of the underlying data of the source forgery method. Our core idea is to first pre-train an encoder neural network, which maps each mode of this distribution to the respective class labels, i.e., real or fake images in the source domain by minimizing wasserstein distance between them. In order to transfer this model to a new domain, we associate a few target samples with one of the previously trained modes. In addition, we propose a spatial mixup augmentation strategy that further helps generalization across domains. We find this learning strategy to be surprisingly effective at domain transfer compared to a traditional classification or even state-of-the-art domain adaptation/few-shot learning methods. For instance, compared to the best baseline, our method improves the classification accuracy by 4.88% for zero-shot and by 8.38% for the few-shot case transferred from the FaceForensics++ to Dessa dataset.      
### 41.Perspective Texture Synthesis Based on Improved Energy Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11851.pdf)
>  Perspective texture synthesis has great significance in many fields like video editing, scene capturing etc., due to its ability to read and control global feature information. In this paper, we present a novel example-based, specifically energy optimization-based algorithm, to synthesize perspective textures. Energy optimization technique is a pixel-based approach, so it is time-consuming. We improve it from two aspects with the purpose of achieving faster synthesis and high quality. Firstly, we change this pixel-based technique by replacing the pixel computation with a little patch. Secondly, we present a novel technique to accelerate searching nearest neighborhoods in energy optimization. Using k- means clustering technique to build a search tree to accelerate the search. Hence, we make use of principal component analysis (PCA) technique to reduce dimensions of input vectors. The high quality results prove that our approach is feasible. Besides, our proposed algorithm needs shorter time relative to other similar methods.      
### 42.Quanta Burst Photography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11840.pdf)
>  Single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerging sensor technology capable of detecting individual incident photons, and capturing their time-of-arrival with high timing precision. While these sensors were limited to single-pixel or low-resolution devices in the past, recently, large (up to 1 MPixel) SPAD arrays have been developed. These single-photon cameras (SPCs) are capable of capturing high-speed sequences of binary single-photon images with no read noise. We present quanta burst photography, a computational photography technique that leverages SPCs as passive imaging devices for photography in challenging conditions, including ultra low-light and fast motion. Inspired by recent success of conventional burst photography, we design algorithms that align and merge binary sequences captured by SPCs into intensity images with minimal motion blur and artifacts, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and high dynamic range. We theoretically analyze the SNR and dynamic range of quanta burst photography, and identify the imaging regimes where it provides significant benefits. We demonstrate, via a recently developed SPAD array, that the proposed method is able to generate high-quality images for scenes with challenging lighting, complex geometries, high dynamic range and moving objects. With the ongoing development of SPAD arrays, we envision quanta burst photography finding applications in both consumer and scientific photography.      
### 43.TreeRNN: Topology-Preserving Deep GraphEmbedding and Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11825.pdf)
>  In contrast to the literature where the graph local patterns are captured by customized graph kernels, in this paper we study the problem of how to effectively and efficiently transfer such graphs into image space so that order-sensitive networks such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can better extract local pattern in this regularized forms. To this end, we propose a novel topology-preserving graph embedding scheme that transfers the graphs into image space via a graph-tree-image projection, which explicitly present the order of graph nodes on the corresponding graph-trees. Addition to the projection, we propose TreeRNN, a 2D RNN architecture that recurrently integrates the graph nodes along with rows and columns of the graph-tree-images to help classify the graphs. At last, we manage to demonstrate a comparable performance on graph classification datasets including MUTAG, PTC, and NCI1.      
### 44.Subspace Clustering for Action Recognition with Covariance Representations and Temporal Pruning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11812.pdf)
>  This paper tackles the problem of human action recognition, defined as classifying which action is displayed in a trimmed sequence, from skeletal data. Albeit state-of-the-art approaches designed for this application are all supervised, in this paper we pursue a more challenging direction: Solving the problem with unsupervised learning. To this end, we propose a novel subspace clustering method, which exploits covariance matrix to enhance the action's discriminability and a timestamp pruning approach that allow us to better handle the temporal dimension of the data. Through a broad experimental validation, we show that our computational pipeline surpasses existing unsupervised approaches but also can result in favorable performances as compared to supervised methods.      
### 45.Sequential Feature Filtering Classifier  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11808.pdf)
>  We propose Sequential Feature Filtering Classifier (FFC), a simple but effective classifier for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With sequential LayerNorm and ReLU, FFC zeroes out low-activation units and preserves high-activation units. The sequential feature filtering process generates multiple features, which are fed into a shared classifier for multiple outputs. FFC can be applied to any CNNs with a classifier, and significantly improves performances with negligible overhead. We extensively validate the efficacy of FFC on various tasks: ImageNet-1K classification, MS COCO detection, Cityscapes segmentation, and HMDB51 action recognition. Moreover, we empirically show that FFC can further improve performances upon other techniques, including attention modules and augmentation techniques. The code and models will be publicly available.      
### 46.Improving Image Captioning with Better Use of Captions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11807.pdf)
>  Image captioning is a multimodal problem that has drawn extensive attention in both the natural language processing and computer vision community. In this paper, we present a novel image captioning architecture to better explore semantics available in captions and leverage that to enhance both image representation and caption generation. Our models first construct caption-guided visual relationship graphs that introduce beneficial inductive bias using weakly supervised multi-instance learning. The representation is then enhanced with neighbouring and contextual nodes with their textual and visual features. During generation, the model further incorporates visual relationships using multi-task learning for jointly predicting word and object/predicate tag sequences. We perform extensive experiments on the MSCOCO dataset, showing that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the baselines, resulting in the state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of evaluation metrics.      
### 47.Flood severity mapping from Volunteered Geographic Information by interpreting water level from images containing people: a case study of Hurricane Harvey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11802.pdf)
>  With increasing urbanization, in recent years there has been a growing interest and need in monitoring and analyzing urban flood events. Social media, as a new data source, can provide real-time information for flood monitoring. The social media posts with locations are often referred to as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI), which can reveal the spatial pattern of such events. Since more images are shared on social media than ever before, recent research focused on the extraction of flood-related posts by analyzing images in addition to texts. Apart from merely classifying posts as flood relevant or not, more detailed information, e.g. the flood severity, can also be extracted based on image interpretation. However, it has been less tackled and has not yet been applied for flood severity mapping. <br>In this paper, we propose a novel three-step pipeline method to extract and map flood severity information. First, flood relevant images are retrieved with the help of pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors. Second, the images containing people are further classified into four severity levels by observing the relationship between body parts and their partial inundation, i.e. images are classified according to the water level with respect to different body parts, namely ankle, knee, hip, and chest. Lastly, locations of the Tweets are used for generating a map of estimated flood extent and severity. This pipeline was applied to an image dataset collected during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, as a proof of concept. The results show that VGI can be used as a supplement to remote sensing observations for flood extent mapping and is beneficial, especially for urban areas, where the infrastructure is often occluding water. Based on the extracted water level information, an integrated overview of flood severity can be provided for the early stages of emergency response.      
### 48.Patch Based Classification of Remote Sensing Data: A Comparison of 2D-CNN, SVM and NN Classifiers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11767.pdf)
>  Pixel based algorithms including back propagation neural networks (NN) and support vector machines (SVM) have been widely used for remotely sensed image classifications. Within last few years, deep learning based image classifier like convolution neural networks (2D-CNN) are becoming popular alternatives to these classifiers. In this paper, we compare performance of patch based SVM and NN with that of a deep learning algorithms comprising of 2D-CNN and fully connected layers. Similar to CNN which utilise image patches to derive features for further classification, we propose to use patches as an input in place of individual pixel with both SVM and NN classifiers. Two datasets, one multispectral and other hyperspectral data was used to compare the performance of different classifiers. Results with both datasets suggest the effectiveness of patch based SVM and NN classifiers in comparison to state of art 2D-CNN classifier.      
### 49.Methodology for Building Synthetic Datasets with Virtual Humans  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11757.pdf)
>  Recent advances in deep learning methods have increased the performance of face detection and recognition systems. The accuracy of these models relies on the range of variation provided in the training data. Creating a dataset that represents all variations of real-world faces is not feasible as the control over the quality of the data decreases with the size of the dataset. Repeatability of data is another challenge as it is not possible to exactly recreate 'real-world' acquisition conditions outside of the laboratory. In this work, we explore a framework to synthetically generate facial data to be used as part of a toolchain to generate very large facial datasets with a high degree of control over facial and environmental variations. Such large datasets can be used for improved, targeted training of deep neural networks. In particular, we make use of a 3D morphable face model for the rendering of multiple 2D images across a dataset of 100 synthetic identities, providing full control over image variations such as pose, illumination, and background.      
### 50.Weak Supervision and Referring Attention for Temporal-Textual Association Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11747.pdf)
>  A system capturing the association between video frames and textual queries offer great potential for better video analysis. However, training such a system in a fully supervised way inevitably demands a meticulously curated video dataset with temporal-textual annotations. Therefore we provide a Weak-Supervised alternative with our proposed Referring Attention mechanism to learn temporal-textual association (dubbed WSRA). The weak supervision is simply a textual expression (e.g., short phrases or sentences) at video level, indicating this video contains relevant frames. The referring attention is our designed mechanism acting as a scoring function for grounding the given queries over frames temporally. It consists of multiple novel losses and sampling strategies for better training. The principle in our designed mechanism is to fully exploit 1) the weak supervision by considering informative and discriminative cues from intra-video segments anchored with the textual query, 2) multiple queries compared to the single video, and 3) cross-video visual similarities. We validate our WSRA through extensive experiments for temporally grounding by languages, demonstrating that it outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods notably.      
### 51.Achieving Better Kinship Recognition Through Better Baseline  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11739.pdf)
>  Recognizing blood relations using face images can be seen as an application of face recognition systems with additional restrictions. These restrictions proved to be difficult to deal with, however, recent advancements in face verification show that there is still much to gain using more data and novel ideas. As a result face recognition is a great source domain from which we can transfer the knowledge to get better performance in kinship recognition as a source domain. We present a new baseline for an automatic kinship recognition task and relatives search based on RetinaFace[1] for face registration and ArcFace[2] face verification model. With the approach described above as the foundation, we constructed a pipeline that achieved state-of-the-art performance on two tracks in the recent Recognizing Families In the Wild Data Challenge.      
### 52.Efficient Integer-Arithmetic-Only Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11735.pdf)
>  Integer-arithmetic-only networks have been demonstrated effective to reduce computational cost and to ensure cross-platform consistency. However, previous works usually report a decline in the inference accuracy when converting well-trained floating-point-number (FPN) networks into integer networks. We analyze this phonomenon and find that the decline is due to activation quantization. Specifically, when we replace conventional ReLU with Bounded ReLU, how to set the bound for each neuron is a key problem. Considering the tradeoff between activation quantization error and network learning ability, we set an empirical rule to tune the bound of each Bounded ReLU. We also design a mechanism to handle the cases of feature map addition and feature map concatenation. Based on the proposed method, our trained 8-bit integer ResNet outperforms the 8-bit networks of Google's TensorFlow and NVIDIA's TensorRT for image recognition. We also experiment on VDSR for image super-resolution and on VRCNN for compression artifact reduction, both of which serve for regression tasks that natively require high inference accuracy. Our integer networks achieve equivalent performance as the corresponding FPN networks, but have only 1/4 memory cost and run 2x faster on modern GPUs.

### 53.Kiwifruit detection in challenging conditions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11729.pdf)
>  Accurate and reliable kiwifruit detection is one of the biggest challenges in developing a selective fruit harvesting robot. The vision system of an orchard robot faces difficulties such as dynamic lighting conditions and fruit occlusions. This paper presents a semantic segmentation approach with two novel image prepossessing techniques designed to detect kiwifruit under the harsh lighting conditions found in the canopy. The performance of the presented system is evaluated on a 3D real-world image set of kiwifruit under different lighting conditions (typical, glare, and overexposed). Alone the semantic segmentation approach achieves an F1_score of 0.82 on the typical lighting image set, but struggles with harsh lighting with an F1_score of 0.13. Utilising the prepossessing techniques the vision system under harsh lighting improves to an F1_score 0.42. To address the fruit occlusion challenge, the overall approach was found to be capable of detecting 87.0% of non-occluded and 30.0% of occluded kiwifruit across all lighting conditions.      
### 54.Pose Trainer: Correcting Exercise Posture using Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11718.pdf)
>  Fitness exercises are very beneficial to personal health and fitness; however, they can also be ineffective and potentially dangerous if performed incorrectly by the user. Exercise mistakes are made when the user does not use the proper form, or pose. In our work, we introduce Pose Trainer, an application that detects the user's exercise pose and provides personalized, detailed recommendations on how the user can improve their form. Pose Trainer uses the state of the art in pose estimation to detect a user's pose, then evaluates the vector geometry of the pose through an exercise to provide useful feedback. We record a dataset of over 100 exercise videos of correct and incorrect form, based on personal training guidelines, and build geometric-heuristic and machine learning algorithms for evaluation. Pose Trainer works on four common exercises and supports any Windows or Linux computer with a GPU.      
### 55.Learning compact generalizable neural representations supporting perceptual grouping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11716.pdf)
>  Work at the intersection of vision science and deep learning is starting to explore the efficacy of deep convolutional networks (DCNs) and recurrent networks in solving perceptual grouping problems that underlie primate visual recognition and segmentation. Here, we extend this line of work to investigate the compactness and generalizability of DCN solutions to learning low-level perceptual grouping routines involving contour integration. We introduce V1Net, a bio-inspired recurrent unit that incorporates lateral connections ubiquitous in cortical circuitry. Feedforward convolutional layers in DCNs can be substituted with V1Net modules to enhance their contextual visual processing support for perceptual grouping. We compare the learning efficiency and accuracy of V1Net-DCNs to that of 14 carefully selected feedforward and recurrent neural architectures (including state-of-the-art DCNs) on MarkedLong -- a synthetic forced-choice contour integration dataset of 800,000 images we introduce here -- and the previously published Pathfinder contour integration benchmarks. We gauged solution generalizability by measuring the transfer learning performance of our candidate models trained on MarkedLong that were fine-tuned to learn PathFinder. Our results demonstrate that a compact 3-layer V1Net-DCN matches or outperforms the test accuracy and sample efficiency of all tested comparison models which contain between 5x and 1000x more trainable parameters; we also note that V1Net-DCN learns the most compact generalizable solution to MarkedLong. A visualization of the temporal dynamics of a V1Net-DCN elucidates its usage of interpretable grouping computations to solve MarkedLong. The compact and rich representations of V1Net-DCN also make it a promising candidate to build on-device machine vision algorithms as well as help better understand biological cortical circuitry.      
### 56.Off-Policy Self-Critical Training for Transformer in Visual Paragraph Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11714.pdf)
>  Recently, several approaches have been proposed to solve language generation problems. Transformer is currently state-of-the-art seq-to-seq model in language generation. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is useful in solving exposure bias and the optimisation on non-differentiable metrics in seq-to-seq language learning. However, Transformer is hard to combine with RL as the costly computing resource is required for sampling. We tackle this problem by proposing an off-policy RL learning algorithm where a behaviour policy represented by GRUs performs the sampling. We reduce the high variance of importance sampling (IS) by applying the truncated relative importance sampling (TRIS) technique and Kullback-Leibler (KL)-control concept. TRIS is a simple yet effective technique, and there is a theoretical proof that KL-control helps to reduce the variance of IS. We formulate this off-policy RL based on self-critical sequence training. Specifically, we use a Transformer-based captioning model as the target policy and use an image-guided language auto-encoder as the behaviour policy to explore the environment. The proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the visual paragraph generation and improved results on image captioning.      
### 57.Exploiting Contextual Information with Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11706.pdf)
>  Context matters! Nevertheless, there has not been much research in exploiting contextual information in deep neural networks. For most part, the entire usage of contextual information has been limited to recurrent neural networks. Attention models and capsule networks are two recent ways of introducing contextual information in non-recurrent models, however both of these algorithms have been developed after this work has started. <br>In this thesis, we show that contextual information can be exploited in 2 fundamentally different ways: implicitly and explicitly. In the DeepScore project, where the usage of context is very important for the recognition of many tiny objects, we show that by carefully crafting convolutional architectures, we can achieve state-of-the-art results, while also being able to implicitly correctly distinguish between objects which are virtually identical, but have different meanings based on their surrounding. In parallel, we show that by explicitly designing algorithms (motivated from graph theory and game theory) that take into considerations the entire structure of the dataset, we can achieve state-of-the-art results in different topics like semi-supervised learning and similarity learning. <br>To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate graph-theoretical modules, carefully crafted for the problem of similarity learning and that are designed to consider contextual information, not only outperforming the other models, but also gaining a speed improvement while using a smaller number of parameters.      
### 58.Fast and Accurate: Structure Coherence Component for Face Alignment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11697.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a fast and accurate coordinate regression method for face alignment. Unlike most existing facial landmark regression methods which usually employ fully connected layers to convert feature maps into landmark coordinate, we present a structure coherence component to explicitly take the relation among facial landmarks into account. Due to the geometric structure of human face, structure coherence between different facial parts provides important cues for effectively localizing facial landmarks. However, the dense connection in the fully connected layers overuses such coherence, making the important cues unable to be distinguished from all connections. Instead, our structure coherence component leverages a dynamic sparse graph structure to passing features among the most related landmarks. Furthermore, we propose a novel objective function, named Soft Wing loss, to improve the accuracy. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks, including WFLW, COFW and 300W, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fast speed. Our approach is especially robust to challenging cases resulting in impressively low failure rate (0% and 2.88%) in COFW and WFLW datasets.      
### 59.Dense-Captioning Events in Videos: SYSU Submission to ActivityNet Challenge 2020  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11693.pdf)
>  This technical report presents a brief description of our submission to the dense video captioning task of ActivityNet Challenge 2020. Our approach follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we extract a set of temporal event proposals; then we propose a multi-event captioning model to capture the event-level temporal relationships and effectively fuse the multi-modal information. Our approach achieves a 9.28 METEOR score on the test set.      
### 60.Semi-Supervised Object Detection with Sparsely Annotated Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11692.pdf)
>  In training object detector based on convolutional neural networks, selection of effective positive examples for training is an important factor. However, when training an anchor-based detectors with sparse annotations on an image, effort to find effective positive examples can hinder training performance. When using the anchor-based training for the ground truth bounding box to collect positive examples under given IoU, it is often possible to include objects from other classes in the current training class, or objects that are needed to be trained can only be sampled as negative examples. We used two approaches to solve this problem: 1) the use of an anchorless object detector and 2) a semi-supervised learning-based object detection using a single object tracker. The proposed technique performs single object tracking by using the sparsely annotated bounding box as an anchor in the temporal domain for successive frames. From the tracking results, dense annotations for training images were generated in an automated manner and used for training the object detector. We applied the proposed single object tracking-based semi-supervised learning to the Epic-Kitchens dataset. As a result, we were able to achieve \textbf{runner-up} performance in the Unseen section while achieving the first place in the Seen section of the Epic-Kitchens 2020 object detection challenge under IoU &gt; 0.5 evaluation      
### 61.Adversarial Transfer of Pose Estimation Regression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11658.pdf)
>  We address the problem of camera pose estimation in visual localization. Current regression-based methods for pose estimation are trained and evaluated scene-wise. They depend on the coordinate frame of the training dataset and show a low generalization across scenes and datasets. We identify the dataset shift an important barrier to generalization and consider transfer learning as an alternative way towards a better reuse of pose estimation models. %To benefit from %for in the image classification and semantic segmentation. e revise domain adaptation techniques for classification and extend them to camera pose estimation, which is a multi-regression task. We develop a deep adaptation network for learning scene-invariant image representations and use adversarial learning to generate such representations for model transfer. We enrich the network with self-supervised learning and use the adaptability theory to validate the existence of scene-invariant representation of images in two given scenes. We evaluate our network on two public datasets, Cambridge Landmarks and 7Scene, demonstrate its superiority over several baselines and compare to the state of the art methods.      
### 62.A numerical framework for elastic surface matching, comparison, and interpolation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11652.pdf)
>  Surface comparison and matching is a challenging problem in computer vision. While reparametrization-invariant Sobolev metrics provide meaningful elastic distances and point correspondences via the geodesic boundary value problem, solving this problem numerically tends to be difficult. Square root normal fields (SRNF) considerably simplify the computation of certain elastic distances between parametrized surfaces. Yet they leave open the issue of finding optimal reparametrizations, which induce elastic distances between unparametrized surfaces. This issue has concentrated much effort in recent years and led to the development of several numerical frameworks. In this paper, we take an alternative approach which bypasses the direct estimation of reparametrizations: we relax the geodesic boundary constraint using an auxiliary parametrization-blind varifold fidelity metric. This reformulation has several notable benefits. By avoiding altogether the need for reparametrizations, it provides the flexibility to deal with simplicial meshes of arbitrary topologies and sampling patterns. Moreover, the problem lends itself to a coarse-to-fine multi-resolution implementation, which makes the algorithm scalable to large meshes. Furthermore, this approach extends readily to higher-order feature maps such as square root curvature fields and is also able to include surface textures in the matching problem. We demonstrate these advantages on several examples, synthetic and real.      
### 63.BRULÉ: Barycenter-Regularized Unsupervised Landmark Extraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11643.pdf)
>  Unsupervised retrieval of image features is vital for many computer vision tasks where the annotation is missing or scarce. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised approach to detect the landmarks in images, and we validate it on the popular task of human face key-points extraction. The method is based on the idea of auto-encoding the wanted landmarks in the latent space while discarding the non-essential information in the image and effectively preserving the interpretability. The interpretable latent space representation is achieved with the aid of a novel two-step regularization paradigm. The first regularization step evaluates transport distance from a given set of landmarks to the average value (the barycenter by Wasserstein distance). The second regularization step controls deviations from the barycenter by applying random geometric deformations synchronously to the initial image and to the encoded landmarks. During decoding, we add style features generated from the noise and reconstruct the initial image by the generative adversarial network (GAN) with transposed convolutions modulated by this style. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach both in unsupervised and in semi-supervised training scenarios using the 300-W and the CelebA datasets. The proposed regularization paradigm is shown to prevent overfitting, and the detection quality is shown to improve beyond the supervised outcome.      
### 64.G2D: Generate to Detect Anomalies  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11629.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel method for irregularity detection. Previous researches solve this problem as an One-Class Classification (OCC) task where they train a reference model on all of the available samples. Then, they consider a test sample as an anomaly if it has a diversion from the reference model. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved the most promising results for OCC while implementing and training such networks, especially for the OCC task, is a cumbersome and computationally expensive procedure. To cope with the mentioned challenges, we present a simple but effective method to solve the irregularity detection as a binary classification task in order to make the implementation easier along with improving the detection performance. We learn two deep neural networks (generator and discriminator) in a GAN-style setting on merely the normal samples. During training, the generator gradually becomes an expert to generate samples which are similar to the normal ones. In the training phase, when the generator fails to produce normal data (in the early stages of learning and also prior to the complete convergence), it can be considered as an irregularity generator. In this way, we simultaneously generate the irregular samples. Afterward, we train a binary classifier on the generated anomalous samples along with the normal instances in order to be capable of detecting irregularities. The proposed framework applies to different related applications of outlier and anomaly detection in images and videos, respectively. The results confirm that our proposed method is superior to the baseline and state-of-the-art solutions.      
### 65.FaceHack: Triggering backdoored facial recognition systems using facial characteristics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11623.pdf)
>  Recent advances in Machine Learning (ML) have opened up new avenues for its extensive use in real-world applications. Facial recognition, specifically, is used from simple friend suggestions in social-media platforms to critical security applications for biometric validation in automated immigration at airports. Considering these scenarios, security vulnerabilities to such ML algorithms pose serious threats with severe outcomes. Recent work demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), typically used in facial recognition systems, are susceptible to backdoor attacks; in other words,the DNNs turn malicious in the presence of a unique trigger. Adhering to common characteristics for being unnoticeable, an ideal trigger is small, localized, and typically not a part of the main im-age. Therefore, detection mechanisms have focused on detecting these distinct trigger-based outliers statistically or through their reconstruction. In this work, we demonstrate that specific changes to facial characteristics may also be used to trigger malicious behavior in an ML model. The changes in the facial attributes maybe embedded artificially using social-media filters or introduced naturally using movements in facial muscles. By construction, our triggers are large, adaptive to the input, and spread over the entire image. We evaluate the success of the attack and validate that it does not interfere with the performance criteria of the model. We also substantiate the undetectability of our triggers by exhaustively testing them with state-of-the-art defenses.      
### 66.How do SGD hyperparameters in natural training affect adversarial robustness?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11604.pdf)
>  Learning rate, batch size and momentum are three important hyperparameters in the SGD algorithm. It is known from the work of Jastrzebski et al. <a class="link-https" data-arxiv-id="1711.04623" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04623">arXiv:1711.04623</a> that large batch size training of neural networks yields models which do not generalize well. Yao et al. <a class="link-https" data-arxiv-id="1802.08241" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08241">arXiv:1802.08241</a> observe that large batch training yields models that have poor adversarial robustness. In the same paper, the authors train models with different batch sizes and compute the eigenvalues of the Hessian of loss function. They observe that as the batch size increases, the dominant eigenvalues of the Hessian become larger. They also show that both adversarial training and small-batch training leads to a drop in the dominant eigenvalues of the Hessian or lowering its spectrum. They combine adversarial training and second order information to come up with a new large-batch training algorithm and obtain robust models with good generalization. In this paper, we empirically observe the effect of the SGD hyperparameters on the accuracy and adversarial robustness of networks trained with unperturbed samples. Jastrzebski et al. considered training models with a fixed learning rate to batch size ratio. They observed that higher the ratio, better is the generalization. We observe that networks trained with constant learning rate to batch size ratio, as proposed in Jastrzebski et al., yield models which generalize well and also have almost constant adversarial robustness, independent of the batch size. We observe that momentum is more effective with varying batch sizes and a fixed learning rate than with constant learning rate to batch size ratio based SGD training.      
### 67.Deep Double-Side Learning Ensemble Model for Few-Shot Parkinson Speech Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11593.pdf)
>  Diagnosis and therapeutic effect assessment of Parkinson disease based on voice data are very important,but its few-shot learning problem is challenging.Although deep learning is good at automatic feature extraction, it suffers from few-shot learning problem. Therefore, the general effective method is first conduct feature extraction based on prior knowledge, and then carry out feature reduction for subsequent classification. However, there are two major problems: 1) Structural information among speech features has not been mined and new features of higher quality have not been reconstructed. 2) Structural information between data samples has not been mined and new samples with higher quality have not been reconstructed. To solve these two problems, based on the existing Parkinson speech feature data set, a deep double-side learning ensemble model is designed in this paper that can reconstruct speech features and samples deeply and simultaneously. As to feature reconstruction, an embedded deep stacked group sparse auto-encoder is designed in this paper to conduct nonlinear feature transformation, so as to acquire new high-level deep features, and then the deep features are fused with original speech features by L1 regularization feature selection method. As to speech sample reconstruction, a deep sample learning algorithm is designed in this paper based on iterative mean clustering to conduct samples transformation, so as to obtain new high-level deep samples. Finally, the bagging ensemble learning mode is adopted to fuse the deep feature learning algorithm and the deep samples learning algorithm together, thereby constructing a deep double-side learning ensemble model. At the end of this paper, two representative speech datasets of Parkinson's disease were used for verification. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm are effective.      
### 68.Driver Intention Anticipation Based on In-Cabin and Driving SceneMonitoring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11557.pdf)
>  Numerous car accidents are caused by improper driving maneuvers. Serious injuries are however avoidable if such driving maneuvers are detected beforehand and the driver is assisted accordingly. In fact, various recent research has focused on the automated prediction of driving maneuver based on hand-crafted features extracted mainly from in-cabin driver videos. Since the outside view from the traffic scene may also contain informative features for driving maneuver prediction, we present a framework for the detection of the drivers' intention based on both in-cabin and traffic scene videos. More specifically, we (1) propose a Convolutional-LSTM (ConvLSTM)-based auto-encoder to extract motion features from the out-cabin traffic, (2) train a classifier which considers motions from both in- and outside of the cabin jointly for maneuver intention anticipation, (3) experimentally prove that the in- and outside image features have complementary information. Our evaluation based on the publicly available dataset Brain4cars shows that our framework achieves a prediction with the accuracy of 83.98% and F1-score of 84.3%.      
### 69.Pyramidal Convolution: Rethinking Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11538.pdf)
>  This work introduces pyramidal convolution (PyConv), which is capable of processing the input at multiple filter scales. PyConv contains a pyramid of kernels, where each level involves different types of filters with varying size and depth, which are able to capture different levels of details in the scene. On top of these improved recognition capabilities, PyConv is also efficient and, with our formulation, it does not increase the computational cost and parameters compared to standard convolution. Moreover, it is very flexible and extensible, providing a large space of potential network architectures for different applications. PyConv has the potential to impact nearly every computer vision task and, in this work, we present different architectures based on PyConv for four main tasks on visual recognition: image classification, video action classification/recognition, object detection and semantic image segmentation/parsing. Our approach shows significant improvements over all these core tasks in comparison with the baselines. For instance, on image recognition, our 50-layers network outperforms in terms of recognition performance on ImageNet dataset its counterpart baseline ResNet with 152 layers, while having 2.39 times less parameters, 2.52 times lower computational complexity and more than 3 times less layers. On image segmentation, our novel framework sets a new state-of-the-art on the challenging ADE20K benchmark for scene parsing.

### 70.G-image Segmentation: Similarity-preserving Fuzzy C-Means with Spatial Information Constraint in Wavelet Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11510.pdf)
>  G-images refer to image data defined on irregular graph domains. This work elaborates a similarity-preserving Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm for G-image segmentation and aims to develop techniques and tools for segmenting G-images. To preserve the membership similarity between an arbitrary image pixel and its neighbors, a Kullback-Leibler divergence term on membership partition is introduced as a part of FCM. As a result, similarity-preserving FCM is developed by considering spatial information of image pixels for its robustness enhancement. Due to superior characteristics of a wavelet space, the proposed FCM is performed in this space rather than Euclidean one used in conventional FCM to secure its high robustness. Experiments on synthetic and real-world G-images demonstrate that it indeed achieves higher robustness and performance than the state-of-the-art FCM algorithms. Moreover, it requires less computation than most of them.      
### 71.Paying more attention to snapshots of Iterative Pruning: Improving Model Compression via Ensemble Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11487.pdf)
>  Network pruning is one of the most dominant methods for reducing the heavy inference cost of deep neural networks. Existing methods often iteratively prune networks to attain high compression ratio without incurring significant loss in performance. However, we argue that conventional methods for retraining pruned networks (i.e., using small, fixed learning rate) are inadequate as they completely ignore the benefits from snapshots of iterative pruning. In this work, we show that strong ensembles can be constructed from snapshots of iterative pruning, which achieve competitive performance and vary in network structure. Furthermore, we present simple, general and effective pipeline that generates strong ensembles of networks during pruning with large learning rate restarting, and utilizes knowledge distillation with those ensembles to improve the predictive power of compact models. In standard image classification benchmarks such as CIFAR and Tiny-Imagenet, we advance state-of-the-art pruning ratio of structured pruning by integrating simple l1-norm filters pruning into our pipeline. Specifically, we reduce 75-80% of total parameters and 65-70% MACs of numerous variants of ResNet architectures while having comparable or better performance than that of original networks.

### 72.Unsupervised Vehicle Re-identification with Progressive Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11486.pdf)
>  Vehicle re-identification (reID) aims at identifying vehicles across different non-overlapping cameras views. The existing methods heavily relied on well-labeled datasets for ideal performance, which inevitably causes fateful drop due to the severe domain bias between the training domain and the real-world scenes; worse still, these approaches required full annotations, which is labor-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel progressive adaptation learning method for vehicle reID, named PAL, which infers from the abundant data without annotations. For PAL, a data adaptation module is employed for source domain, which generates the images with similar data distribution to unlabeled target domain as ``pseudo target samples''. These pseudo samples are combined with the unlabeled samples that are selected by a dynamic sampling strategy to make training faster. We further proposed a weighted label smoothing (WLS) loss, which considers the similarity between samples with different clusters to balance the confidence of pseudo labels. Comprehensive experimental results validate the advantages of PAL on both VehicleID and VeRi-776 dataset.      
### 73.Pseudo-LiDAR Point Cloud Interpolation Based on 3D Motion Representation and Spatial Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11481.pdf)
>  Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation is a novel and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving, which aims to address the frequency mismatching problem between camera and LiDAR. Previous works represent the 3D spatial motion relationship induced by a coarse 2D optical flow, and the quality of interpolated point clouds only depends on the supervision of depth maps. As a result, the generated point clouds suffer from inferior global distributions and local appearances. To solve the above problems, we propose a Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation network to generates temporally and spatially high-quality point cloud sequences. By exploiting the scene flow between point clouds, the proposed network is able to learn a more accurate representation of the 3D spatial motion relationship. For the more comprehensive perception of the distribution of point cloud, we design a novel reconstruction loss function that implements the chamfer distance to supervise the generation of Pseudo-LiDAR point clouds in 3D space. In addition, we introduce a multi-modal deep aggregation module to facilitate the efficient fusion of texture and depth features. As the benefits of the improved motion representation, training loss function, and model structure, our approach gains significant improvements on the Pseudo-LiDAR point cloud interpolation task. The experimental results evaluated on KITTI dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed network, quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 74.Unsupervised Image Classification for Deep Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11480.pdf)
>  Deep clustering against self-supervised learning is a very important and promising direction for unsupervised visual representation learning since it requires little domain knowledge to design pretext tasks. However, the key component, embedding clustering, limits its extension to the extremely large-scale dataset due to its prerequisite to save the global latent embedding of the entire dataset. In this work, we aim to make this framework more simple and elegant without performance decline. We propose an unsupervised image classification framework without using embedding clustering, which is very similar to standard supervised training manner. For detailed interpretation, we further analyze its relation with deep clustering and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on ImageNet dataset have been conducted to prove the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, the experiments on transfer learning benchmarks have verified its generalization to other downstream tasks, including multi-label image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and few-shot image classification.      
### 75.Video Playback Rate Perception for Self-supervisedSpatio-Temporal Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11476.pdf)
>  In self-supervised spatio-temporal representation learning, the temporal resolution and long-short term characteristics are not yet fully explored, which limits representation capabilities of learned models. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method, referred to as video Playback Rate Perception (PRP), to learn spatio-temporal representation in a simple-yet-effective way. PRP roots in a dilated sampling strategy, which produces self-supervision signals about video playback rates for representation model learning. PRP is implemented with a feature encoder, a classification module, and a reconstructing decoder, to achieve spatio-temporal semantic retention in a collaborative discrimination-generation manner. The discriminative perception model follows a feature encoder to prefer perceiving low temporal resolution and long-term representation by classifying fast-forward rates. The generative perception model acts as a feature decoder to focus on comprehending high temporal resolution and short-term representation by introducing a motion-attention mechanism. PRP is applied on typical video target tasks including action recognition and video retrieval. Experiments show that PRP outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised models with significant margins.

### 76.BEV-Seg: Bird's Eye View Semantic Segmentation Using Geometry and Semantic Point Cloud  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11436.pdf)
>  Bird's-eye-view (BEV) is a powerful and widely adopted representation for road scenes that captures surrounding objects and their spatial locations, along with overall context in the scene. In this work, we focus on bird's eye semantic segmentation, a task that predicts pixel-wise semantic segmentation in BEV from side RGB images. This task is made possible by simulators such as Carla, which allow for cheap data collection, arbitrary camera placements, and supervision in ways otherwise not possible in the real world. There are two main challenges to this task: the view transformation from side view to bird's eye view, as well as transfer learning to unseen domains. Existing work transforms between views through fully connected layers and transfer learns via GANs. This suffers from a lack of depth reasoning and performance degradation across domains. Our novel 2-staged perception pipeline explicitly predicts pixel depths and combines them with pixel semantics in an efficient manner, allowing the model to leverage depth information to infer objects' spatial locations in the BEV. In addition, we transfer learning by abstracting high-level geometric features and predicting an intermediate representation that is common across different domains. We publish a new dataset called BEVSEG-Carla and show that our approach improves state-of-the-art by 24% mIoU and performs well when transferred to a new domain.      
### 77.A Symbolic Temporal Pooling method for Video-based Person Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11416.pdf)
>  In video-based person re-identification, both the spatial and temporal features are known to provide orthogonal cues to effective representations. Such representations are currently typically obtained by aggregating the frame-level features using max/avg pooling, at different points of the models. However, such operations also decrease the amount of discriminating information available, which is particularly hazardous in case of poor separability between the different classes. To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces a symbolic temporal pooling method, where frame-level features are represented in the distribution valued symbolic form, yielding from fitting an Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) to each feature. Also, considering that the original triplet loss formulation cannot be applied directly to this kind of representations, we introduce a symbolic triplet loss function that infers the similarity between two symbolic objects. Having carried out an extensive empirical evaluation of the proposed solution against the state-of-the-art, in four well known data sets (MARS, iLIDS-VID, PRID2011 and P-DESTRE), the observed results point for consistent improvements in performance over the previous best performing techniques.      
### 78.Visualizing and Understanding Vision System  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11413.pdf)
>  How the human vision system addresses the object identity-preserving recognition problem is largely unknown. Here, we use a vision recognition-reconstruction network (RRN) to investigate the development, recognition, learning and forgetting mechanisms, and achieve similar characteristics to electrophysiological measurements in monkeys. First, in network development study, the RRN also experiences critical developmental stages characterized by specificities in neuron types, synapse and activation patterns, and visual task performance from the early stage of coarse salience map recognition to mature stage of fine structure recognition. In digit recognition study, we witness that the RRN could maintain object invariance representation under various viewing conditions by coordinated adjustment of responses of population neurons. And such concerted population responses contained untangled object identity and properties information that could be accurately extracted via high-level cortices or even a simple weighted summation decoder. In the learning and forgetting study, novel structure recognition is implemented by adjusting entire synapses in low magnitude while pattern specificities of original synaptic connectivity are preserved, which guaranteed a learning process without disrupting the existing functionalities. This work benefits the understanding of the human visual processing mechanism and the development of human-like machine intelligence.      
### 79.High-contrast "gaudy" images improve the training of deep neural network models of visual cortex  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11412.pdf)
>  A key challenge in understanding the sensory transformations of the visual system is to obtain a highly predictive model of responses from visual cortical neurons. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a promising candidate for such a model. However, DNNs require orders of magnitude more training data than neuroscientists can collect from real neurons because experimental recording time is severely limited. This motivates us to find images that train highly-predictive DNNs with as little training data as possible. We propose gaudy images---high-contrast binarized versions of natural images---to efficiently train DNNs. In extensive simulation experiments, we find that training DNNs with gaudy images substantially reduces the number of training images needed to accurately predict the simulated responses of visual cortical neurons. We also find that gaudy images, chosen before training, outperform images chosen during training by active learning algorithms. Thus, gaudy images overemphasize features of natural images, especially edges, that are the most important for efficiently training DNNs. We believe gaudy images will aid in the modeling of visual cortical neurons, potentially opening new scientific questions about visual processing, as well as aid general practitioners that seek ways to improve the training of DNNs.      
### 80.Quasi-conformal Geometry based Local Deformation Analysis of Lateral Cephalogram for Childhood OSA Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11408.pdf)
>  Craniofacial profile is one of the anatomical causes of obstructive sleep apnea(OSA). By medical research, cephalometry provides information on patients' skeletal structures and soft tissues. In this work, a novel approach to cephalometric analysis using quasi-conformal geometry based local deformation information was proposed for OSA classification. Our study was a retrospective analysis based on 60 case-control pairs with accessible lateral cephalometry and polysomnography (PSG) data. By using the quasi-conformal geometry to study the local deformation around 15 landmark points, and combining the results with three linear distances between landmark points, a total of 1218 information features were obtained per subject. A L2 norm based classification model was built. Under experiments, our proposed model achieves 92.5% testing accuracy.      
### 81.Pedestrian Tracking with Gated Recurrent Units and Attention Mechanisms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11407.pdf)
>  Pedestrian tracking has long been considered an important problem, especially in security applications. Previously,many approaches have been proposed with various types of sensors. One popular method is Pedestrian Dead Reckoning(PDR) [1] which is based on the inertial measurement unit(IMU) sensor. However PDR is an integration and threshold based method, which suffers from accumulation errors and low accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method in which the sensor data is fed into a deep learning model to predict the displacements and orientations of the pedestrian. We also devise a new apparatus to collect and construct databases containing synchronized IMU sensor data and precise locations measured by a LIDAR. The preliminary results are promising, and we plan to push this forward by collecting more data and adapting the deep learning model for all general pedestrian motions.      
### 82.Location, location, location: Satellite image-based real-estate appraisal  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11406.pdf)
>  Buying a home is one of the most important buying decisions people have to make in their life. The latest research on real-estate appraisal focuses on incorporating image data in addition to structured data into the modeling process. This research measures the prediction performance of satellite images and structured data by using convolutional neural networks. The resulting CNN model trained performs 7% better in MAE than the advanced baseline of a neural network trained on structured data. Moreover, sliding-window heatmap provides visual interpretability of satellite images, revealing that neighborhood structures are essential in the price estimation.      
### 83.M2P2: Multimodal Persuasion Prediction using Adaptive Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11405.pdf)
>  Identifying persuasive speakers in an adversarial environment is a critical task. In a national election, politicians would like to have persuasive speakers campaign on their behalf. When a company faces adverse publicity, they would like to engage persuasive advocates for their position in the presence of adversaries who are critical of them. Debates represent a common platform for these forms of adversarial persuasion. This paper solves two problems: the Debate Outcome Prediction (DOP) problem predicts who wins a debate while the Intensity of Persuasion Prediction (IPP) problem predicts the change in the number of votes before and after a speaker speaks. Though DOP has been previously studied, we are the first to study IPP. Past studies on DOP fail to leverage two important aspects of multimodal data: 1) multiple modalities are often semantically aligned, and 2) different modalities may provide diverse information for prediction. Our M2P2 (Multimodal Persuasion Prediction) framework is the first to use multimodal (acoustic, visual, language) data to solve the IPP problem. To leverage the alignment of different modalities while maintaining the diversity of the cues they provide, M2P2 devises a novel adaptive fusion learning framework which fuses embeddings obtained from two modules -- an alignment module that extracts shared information between modalities and a heterogeneity module that learns the weights of different modalities with guidance from three separately trained unimodal reference models. We test M2P2 on the popular IQ2US dataset designed for DOP. We also introduce a new dataset called QPS (from Qipashuo, a popular Chinese debate TV show ) for IPP. M2P2 significantly outperforms 3 recent baselines on both datasets.

### 84.Auto-Encoding for Shared Cross Domain Feature Representation and Image-to-Image Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11404.pdf)
>  Image-to-image translation is a subset of computer vision and pattern recognition problems where our goal is to learn a mapping between input images of domain $\mathbf{X}_1$ and output images of domain $\mathbf{X}_2$. Current methods use neural networks with an encoder-decoder structure to learn a mapping $G:\mathbf{X}_1 \to\mathbf{X}_2$ such that the distribution of images from $\mathbf{X}_2$ and $G(\mathbf{X}_1)$ are identical, where $G(\mathbf{X}_1) = d_G (f_G (\mathbf{X}_1))$ and $f_G (\cdot)$ is referred as the encoder and $d_G(\cdot)$ is referred to as the decoder. Currently, such methods which also compute an inverse mapping $F:\mathbf{X}_2 \to \mathbf{X}_1$ use a separate encoder-decoder pair $d_F (f_F (\mathbf{X}_2))$ or at least a separate decoder $d_F (\cdot)$ to do so. Here we introduce a method to perform cross domain image-to-image translation across multiple domains using a single encoder-decoder architecture. We use an auto-encoder network which given an input image $\mathbf{X}_1$, first computes a latent domain encoding $Z_d = f_d (\mathbf{X}_1)$ and a latent content encoding $Z_c = f_c (\mathbf{X}_1)$, where the domain encoding $Z_d$ and content encoding $Z_c$ are independent. And then a decoder network $g(Z_d,Z_c)$ creates a reconstruction of the original image $\mathbf{\widehat{X}}_1=g(Z_d,Z_c )\approx \mathbf{X}_1$. Ideally, the domain encoding $Z_d$ contains no information regarding the content of the image and the content encoding $Z_c$ contains no information regarding the domain of the image. We use this property of the encodings to find the mapping across domains $G: X\to Y$ by simply changing the domain encoding $Z_d$ of the decoder's input. $G(\mathbf{X}_1 )=d(f_d (\mathbf{x}_2^i ),f_c (\mathbf{X}_1))$ where $\mathbf{x}_2^i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation of $\mathbf{X}_2$.      
### 85.Salienteye: Maximizing Engagement While Maintaining Artistic Style on Instagram Using Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11403.pdf)
>  Instagram has become a great venue for amateur and professional photographers alike to showcase their work. It has, in other words, democratized photography. Generally, photographers take thousands of photos in a session, from which they pick a few to showcase their work on Instagram. Photographers trying to build a reputation on Instagram have to strike a balance between maximizing their followers' engagement with their photos, while also maintaining their artistic style. We used transfer learning to adapt Xception, which is a model for object recognition trained on the ImageNet dataset, to the task of engagement prediction and utilized Gram matrices generated from VGG19, another object recognition model trained on ImageNet, for the task of style similarity measurement on photos posted on Instagram. Our models can be trained on individual Instagram accounts to create personalized engagement prediction and style similarity models. Once trained on their accounts, users can have new photos sorted based on predicted engagement and style similarity to their previous work, thus enabling them to upload photos that not only have the potential to maximize engagement from their followers but also maintain their style of photography. We trained and validated our models on several Instagram accounts, showing it to be adept at both tasks, also outperforming several baseline models and human annotators.      
### 86.Semantically Tied Paired Cycle Consistency for Any-Shot Sketch-based Image Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11397.pdf)
>  Low-shot sketch-based image retrieval is an emerging task in computer vision, allowing to retrieve natural images relevant to hand-drawn sketch queries that are rarely seen during the training phase. Related prior works either require aligned sketch-image pairs that are costly to obtain or inefficient memory fusion layer for mapping the visual information to a semantic space. In this paper, we address any-shot, i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) tasks, where we introduce the few-shot setting for SBIR. For solving these tasks, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (SEM-PCYC) for any-shot SBIR, where each branch of the generative adversarial network maps the visual information from sketch and image to a common semantic space via adversarial training. Each of these branches maintains cycle consistency that only requires supervision at the category level, and avoids the need of aligned sketch-image pairs. A classification criteria on the generators' outputs ensures the visual to semantic space mapping to be class-specific. Furthermore, we propose to combine textual and hierarchical side information via an auto-encoder that selects discriminating side information within a same end-to-end model. Our results demonstrate a significant boost in any-shot SBIR performance over the state-of-the-art on the extended version of the challenging Sketchy, TU-Berlin and QuickDraw datasets.      
### 87.Deep Learning Based Single Sample Per Person Face Recognition: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11395.pdf)
>  Face recognition has been an active research area in the field of pattern recognition, especially since the rise of deep learning in recent years. However, in some practical situations, each identity in the training set has only a single sample. This type of situation is called Single Sample Per Person (SSPP), which brings a great challenge to the effective training of deep models. To resolve this issue, and to unleash the full potential of deep learning, many deep learning based SSPP face recognition methods have been proposed in recent years. There have been several comprehensive surveys for traditional methods based SSPP face recognition approaches, but emerging deep learning based methods are rarely involved. In this paper, we focus on those deep methods, classifying them as virtual sample methods and generic learning methods. In virtual sample methods, virtual face images or virtual face features are generated to benefit the training of the deep model. In generic learning methods, additional multi-sample generic set are used. Efforts of traditional methods and deep feature combining, loss function improving and network structure improving are involved in our analysis in the generic learning methods section. Finally, we discuss existing problems of identity information retention in virtual sample methods and domain adaption in generic learning methods. Further, we regard the semantic gap as an important future issue that needs to be considered in deep SSPP methods.      
### 88.Unifying Few- and Zero-Shot Egocentric Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11393.pdf)
>  Although there has been significant research in egocentric action recognition, most methods and tasks, including EPIC-KITCHENS, suppose a fixed set of action classes. Fixed-set classification is useful for benchmarking methods, but is often unrealistic in practical settings due to the compositionality of actions, resulting in a functionally infinite-cardinality label set. In this work, we explore generalization with an open set of classes by unifying two popular approaches: few- and zero-shot generalization (the latter which we reframe as cross-modal few-shot generalization). We propose a new set of splits derived from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset that allow evaluation of open-set classification, and use these splits to show that adding a metric-learning loss to the conventional direct-alignment baseline can improve zero-shot classification by as much as 10%, while not sacrificing few-shot performance.      
### 89.Computer Vision with Deep Learning for Plant Phenotyping in Agriculture: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11391.pdf)
>  In light of growing challenges in agriculture with ever growing food demand across the world, efficient crop management techniques are necessary to increase crop yield. Precision agriculture techniques allow the stakeholders to make effective and customized crop management decisions based on data gathered from monitoring crop environments. Plant phenotyping techniques play a major role in accurate crop monitoring. Advancements in deep learning have made previously difficult phenotyping tasks possible. This survey aims to introduce the reader to the state of the art research in deep plant phenotyping.      
### 90.Sparsifying and Down-scaling Networks to Increase Robustness to Distortions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11389.pdf)
>  It has been shown that perfectly trained networks exhibit drastic reduction in performance when presented with distorted images. Streaming Network (STNet) is a novel architecture capable of robust classification of the distorted images while been trained on undistorted images. The distortion robustness is enabled by means of sparse input and isolated parallel streams with decoupled weights. Recent results prove STNet is robust to 20 types of noise and distortions. STNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance for classification of low light images, while being of much smaller size when other networks. In this paper, we construct STNets by using scaled versions (number of filters in each layer is reduced by factor of n) of popular networks like VGG16, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 as parallel streams. These new STNets are tested on several datasets. Our results indicate that more efficient (less FLOPS), new STNets exhibit higher or equal accuracy in comparison with original networks. Considering a diversity of datasets and networks used for tests, we conclude that a new type of STNets is an efficient tool for robust classification of distorted images.      
### 91.A Transductive Multi-Head Model for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11384.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a new method, Transductive Multi-Head Few-Shot learning (TMHFS), to address the Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) challenge. The TMHFS method extends the Meta-Confidence Transduction (MCT) and Dense Feature-Matching Networks (DFMN) method [2] by introducing a new prediction head, i.e, an instance-wise global classification network based on semantic information, after the common feature embedding network. We train the embedding network with the multiple heads, i.e,, the MCT loss, the DFMN loss and the semantic classifier loss, simultaneously in the source domain. For the few-shot learning in the target domain, we first perform fine-tuning on the embedding network with only the semantic global classifier and the support instances, and then use the MCT part to predict labels of the query set with the fine-tuned embedding network. Moreover, we further exploit data augmentation techniques during the fine-tuning and test stages to improve the prediction performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods greatly outperform the strong baseline, fine-tuning, on four different target domains.      
### 92.Improving Train Track Safety using Drones, Computer Vision and Machine Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11379.pdf)
>  Millions of human casualties resulting from train accidents globally are caused by the inefficient, manual track inspections. Government agencies are seriously concerned about the safe operations of the rail industry after series of accidents reported across e USA and around the globe, mainly attributed to track defects. Casualties resulting from track defects result in billions of dollars loss in public and private investments and loss of revenue due to downtime, ultimately resulting in loss of the public's confidence. The manual, mundane, and expensive monitoring of rail track safety can be transform through the use of drones, computer vision, and machine learning. The primary goal of this study is to develop multiple algorithms that implement supervised and semi-supervised learning that accurately analyze whether a track is safe or unsafe based on simulated training data of train tracks. This includes being able to develop a Convolutional Neural Network that can identify track defects using supervised learning without having to specify a particular algorithm for detecting those defects, and that the new model would both speed up and improve the quality of the track defect detection process, accompanied with a computer vision image-processing algorithm. Our other goals included designing and building a prototype representation of train tracks to simulate track defects, to precisely and consistently conduct the visual inspection using drones. Ultimately, the goal demonstrates that the state of good repairs in railway tracks can be attained through the use of drones, computer vision and machine learning.      
### 93.StressGAN: A Generative Deep Learning Model for 2D Stress Distribution Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11376.pdf)
>  Using deep learning to analyze mechanical stress distributions has been gaining interest with the demand for fast stress analysis methods. Deep learning approaches have achieved excellent outcomes when utilized to speed up stress computation and learn the physics without prior knowledge of underlying equations. However, most studies restrict the variation of geometry or boundary conditions, making these methods difficult to be generalized to unseen configurations. We propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) model for predicting 2D von Mises stress distributions in solid structures. The cGAN learns to generate stress distributions conditioned by geometries, load, and boundary conditions through a two-player minimax game between two neural networks with no prior knowledge. By evaluating the generative network on two stress distribution datasets under multiple metrics, we demonstrate that our model can predict more accurate high-resolution stress distributions than a baseline convolutional neural network model, given various and complex cases of geometry, load and boundary conditions.      
### 94.Segmentation task for fashion and apparel  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11375.pdf)
>  The Fashion Industry is a strong and important industry in the global economy. Globalization has brought fast fashion, quick shifting consumer shopping preferences, more competition, and abundance in fashion shops and retailers, making it more difficult for professionals in the fashion industry to keep track of what fashion items people wear and how they combine them. This paper solves this problem by implementing several Deep Learning Architectures using the iMaterialist dataset consisting of 45,000 images with 46 different clothing and apparel categories.      
### 95.Bombus Species Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11374.pdf)
>  Entomologists, ecologists and others struggle to rapidly and accurately identify the species of bumble bees they encounter in their field work and research. The current process requires the bees to be mounted, then physically shipped to a taxonomic expert for proper categorization. We investigated whether an image classification system derived from transfer learning can do this task. We used Google Inception, Oxford VGG16 and VGG19 and Microsoft ResNet 50. We found Inception and VGG classifiers were able to make some progress at identifying bumble bee species from the available data, whereas ResNet was not. Individual classifiers achieved accuracies of up to 23% for single species identification and 44% top-3 labels, where a composite model performed better, 27% and 50%. We feel the performance was most hampered by our limited data set of 5,000-plus labeled images of 29 species, with individual species represented by 59 -315 images.      
### 96.Deceiving computers in Reverse Turing Test through Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11373.pdf)
>  It is increasingly becoming difficult for human beings to work on their day to day life without going through the process of reverse Turing test, where the Computers tests the users to be humans or not. Almost every website and service providers today have the process of checking whether their website is being crawled or not by automated bots which could extract valuable information from their site. In the process the bots are getting more intelligent by the use of Deep Learning techniques to decipher those tests and gain unwanted automated access to data while create nuisance by posting spam. Humans spend a considerable amount of time almost every day when trying to decipher CAPTCHAs. The aim of this investigation is to check whether the use of a subset of commonly used CAPTCHAs, known as the text CAPTCHA is a reliable process for verifying their human customers. We mainly focused on the preprocessing step for every CAPTCHA which converts them in binary intensity and removes the confusion as much as possible and developed various models to correctly label as many CAPTCHAs as possible. We also suggested some ways to improve the process of verifying the humans which makes it easy for humans to solve the existing CAPTCHAs and difficult for bots to do the same.      
### 97.Learning Tversky Similarity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11372.pdf)
>  In this paper, we advocate Tversky's ratio model as an appropriate basis for computational approaches to semantic similarity, that is, the comparison of objects such as images in a semantically meaningful way. We consider the problem of learning Tversky similarity measures from suitable training data indicating whether two objects tend to be similar or dissimilar. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach to similarity learning on two image datasets, showing that is performs very well compared to existing methods.      
### 98.Opportunities and Challenges in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11371.pdf)
>  Nowadays, deep neural networks are widely used in mission critical systems such as healthcare, self-driving vehicles, and military which have direct impact on human lives. However, the black-box nature of deep neural networks challenges its use in mission critical applications, raising ethical and judicial concerns inducing lack of trust. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that promotes a set of tools, techniques, and algorithms that can generate high-quality interpretable, intuitive, human-understandable explanations of AI decisions. In addition to providing a holistic view of the current XAI landscape in deep learning, this paper provides mathematical summaries of seminal work. We start by proposing a taxonomy and categorizing the XAI techniques based on their scope of explanations, methodology behind the algorithms, and explanation level or usage which helps build trustworthy, interpretable, and self-explanatory deep learning models. We then describe the main principles used in XAI research and present the historical timeline for landmark studies in XAI from 2007 to 2020. After explaining each category of algorithms and approaches in detail, we then evaluate the explanation maps generated by eight XAI algorithms on image data, discuss the limitations of this approach, and provide potential future directions to improve XAI evaluation.      
### 99.A survey of face recognition techniques under occlusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11366.pdf)
>  The limited capacity to recognize faces under occlusions is a long-standing problem that presents a unique challenge for face recognition systems and even for humans. The problem regarding occlusion is less covered by research when compared to other challenges such as pose variation, different expressions, etc. Nevertheless, occluded face recognition is imperative to exploit the full potential of face recognition for real-world applications. In this paper, we restrict the scope to occluded face recognition. First, we explore what the occlusion problem is and what inherent difficulties can arise. As a part of this review, we introduce face detection under occlusion, a preliminary step in face recognition. Second, we present how existing face recognition methods cope with the occlusion problem and classify them into three categories, which are 1) occlusion robust feature extraction approaches, 2) occlusion aware face recognition approaches, and 3) occlusion recovery based face recognition approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the motivations, innovations, pros and cons, and the performance of representative approaches for comparison. Finally, future challenges and method trends of occluded face recognition are thoroughly discussed.      
### 100.Manifolds for Unsupervised Visual Anomaly Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11364.pdf)
>  Anomalies are by definition rare, thus labeled examples are very limited or nonexistent, and likely do not cover unforeseen scenarios. Unsupervised learning methods that don't necessarily encounter anomalies in training would be immensely useful. Generative vision models can be useful in this regard but do not sufficiently represent normal and abnormal data distributions. To this end, we propose constant curvature manifolds for embedding data distributions in unsupervised visual anomaly detection. Through theoretical and empirical explorations of manifold shapes, we develop a novel hyperspherical Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) via stereographic projections with a gyroplane layer - a complete equivalent to the Poincaré VAE. This approach with manifold projections is beneficial in terms of model generalization and can yield more interpretable representations. We present state-of-the-art results on visual anomaly benchmarks in precision manufacturing and inspection, demonstrating real-world utility in industrial AI scenarios. We further demonstrate the approach on the challenging problem of histopathology: our unsupervised approach effectively detects cancerous brain tissue from noisy whole-slide images, learning a smooth, latent organization of tissue types that provides an interpretable decisions tool for medical professionals.      
### 101.Real-time Pupil Tracking from Monocular Video for Digital Puppetry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11341.pdf)
>  We present a simple, real-time approach for pupil tracking from live video on mobile devices. Our method extends a state-of-the-art face mesh detector with two new components: a tiny neural network that predicts positions of the pupils in 2D, and a displacement-based estimation of the pupil blend shape coefficients. Our technique can be used to accurately control the pupil movements of a virtual puppet, and lends liveliness and energy to it. The proposed approach runs at over 50 FPS on modern phones, and enables its usage in any real-time puppeteering pipeline.      
### 102.Video Panoptic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11339.pdf)
>  Panoptic segmentation has become a new standard of visual recognition task by unifying previous semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks in concert. In this paper, we propose and explore a new video extension of this task, called video panoptic segmentation. The task requires generating consistent panoptic segmentation as well as an association of instance ids across video frames. To invigorate research on this new task, we present two types of video panoptic datasets. The first is a re-organization of the synthetic VIPER dataset into the video panoptic format to exploit its large-scale pixel annotations. The second is a temporal extension on the Cityscapes val. set, by providing new video panoptic annotations (Cityscapes-VPS). Moreover, we propose a novel video panoptic segmentation network (VPSNet) which jointly predicts object classes, bounding boxes, masks, instance id tracking, and semantic segmentation in video frames. To provide appropriate metrics for this task, we propose a video panoptic quality (VPQ) metric and evaluate our method and several other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented two datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results in image PQ on Cityscapes and also in VPQ on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets. The datasets and code are made publicly available.      
### 103.Image Sentiment Transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11337.pdf)
>  In this work, we introduce an important but still unexplored research task -- image sentiment transfer. Compared with other related tasks that have been well-studied, such as image-to-image translation and image style transfer, transferring the sentiment of an image is more challenging. Given an input image, the rule to transfer the sentiment of each contained object can be completely different, making existing approaches that perform global image transfer by a single reference image inadequate to achieve satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose an effective and flexible framework that performs image sentiment transfer at the object level. It first detects the objects and extracts their pixel-level masks, and then performs object-level sentiment transfer guided by multiple reference images for the corresponding objects. For the core object-level sentiment transfer, we propose a novel Sentiment-aware GAN (SentiGAN). Both global image-level and local object-level supervisions are imposed to train SentiGAN. More importantly, an effective content disentanglement loss cooperating with a content alignment step is applied to better disentangle the residual sentiment-related information of the input image. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments are performed on the object-oriented VSO dataset we create, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.      
### 104.Locally Masked Convolution for Autoregressive Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12486.pdf)
>  High-dimensional generative models have many applications including image compression, multimedia generation, anomaly detection and data completion. State-of-the-art estimators for natural images are autoregressive, decomposing the joint distribution over pixels into a product of conditionals parameterized by a deep neural network, e.g. a convolutional neural network such as the PixelCNN. However, PixelCNNs only model a single decomposition of the joint, and only a single generation order is efficient. For tasks such as image completion, these models are unable to use much of the observed context. To generate data in arbitrary orders, we introduce LMConv: a simple modification to the standard 2D convolution that allows arbitrary masks to be applied to the weights at each location in the image. Using LMConv, we learn an ensemble of distribution estimators that share parameters but differ in generation order, achieving improved performance on whole-image density estimation (2.89 bpd on unconditional CIFAR10), as well as globally coherent image completions. Our code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://ajayjain.github.io/lmconv" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 105.Effective Version Space Reduction for Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12456.pdf)
>  In active learning, sampling bias could pose a serious inconsistency problem and hinder the algorithm from finding the optimal hypothesis. However, many methods for neural networks are hypothesis space agnostic and do not address this problem. We examine active learning with convolutional neural networks through the principled lens of version space reduction. We identify the connection between two approaches---prior mass reduction and diameter reduction---and propose a new diameter-based querying method---the minimum Gibbs-vote disagreement. By estimating version space diameter and bias, we illustrate how version space of neural networks evolves and examine the realizability assumption. With experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, SVHN and STL-10 datasets, we demonstrate that diameter reduction methods reduce the version space more effectively and perform better than prior mass reduction and other baselines, and that the Gibbs vote disagreement is on par with the best query method.      
### 106.Cardiac Segmentation on Late Gadolinium Enhancement MRI: A Benchmark Study from Multi-Sequence Cardiac MR Segmentation Challenge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12434.pdf)
>  Accurate computing, analysis and modeling of the ventricles and myocardium from medical images are important, especially in the diagnosis and treatment management for patients suffering from myocardial infarction (MI). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides an important protocol to visualize MI. However, automated segmentation of LGE CMR is still challenging, due to the indistinguishable boundaries, heterogeneous intensity distribution and complex enhancement patterns of pathological myocardium from LGE CMR. Furthermore, compared with the other sequences LGE CMR images with gold standard labels are particularly limited, which represents another obstacle for developing novel algorithms for automatic segmentation of LGE CMR. This paper presents the selective results from the Multi-Sequence Cardiac MR (MS-CMR) Segmentation challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2019. The challenge offered a data set of paired MS-CMR images, including auxiliary CMR sequences as well as LGE CMR, from 45 patients who underwent cardiomyopathy. It was aimed to develop new algorithms, as well as benchmark existing ones for LGE CMR segmentation and compare them objectively. In addition, the paired MS-CMR images could enable algorithms to combine the complementary information from the other sequences for the segmentation of LGE CMR. Nine representative works were selected for evaluation and comparisons, among which three methods are unsupervised methods and the other six are supervised. The results showed that the average performance of the nine methods was comparable to the inter-observer variations. The success of these methods was mainly attributed to the inclusion of the auxiliary sequences from the MS-CMR images, which provide important label information for the training of deep neural networks.      
### 107.Deep Negative Volume Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12430.pdf)
>  Clinical examination of three-dimensional image data of compound anatomical objects, such as complex joints, remains a tedious process, demanding the time and the expertise of physicians. For instance, automation of the segmentation task of the TMJ (temporomandibular joint) has been hindered by its compound three-dimensional shape, multiple overlaid textures, an abundance of surrounding irregularities in the skull, and a virtually omnidirectional range of the jaw's motion - all of which extend the manual annotation process to more than an hour per patient. To address the challenge, we invent a new angle to the 3D segmentation task: namely, we propose to segment empty spaces between all the tissues surrounding the object - the so-called negative volume segmentation. Our approach is an end-to-end pipeline that comprises a V-Net for bone segmentation, a 3D volume construction by inflation of the reconstructed bone head in all directions along the normal vector to its mesh faces. Eventually confined within the skull bones, the inflated surface occupies the entire "negative" space in the joint, effectively providing a geometrical/topological metric of the joint's health. We validate the idea on the CT scans in a 50-patient dataset, annotated by experts in maxillofacial medicine, quantitatively compare the asymmetry given the left and the right negative volumes, and automate the entire framework for clinical adoption.      
### 108.Deep Learning feature selection to unhide demographic recommender systems factors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12379.pdf)
>  Extracting demographic features from hidden factors is an innovative concept that provides multiple and relevant applications. The matrix factorization model generates factors which do not incorporate semantic knowledge. This paper provides a deep learning-based method: DeepUnHide, able to extract demographic information from the users and items factors in collaborative filtering recommender systems. The core of the proposed method is the gradient-based localization used in the image processing literature to highlight the representative areas of each classification class. Validation experiments make use of two public datasets and current baselines. Results show the superiority of DeepUnHide to make feature selection and demographic classification, compared to the state of art of feature selection methods. Relevant and direct applications include recommendations explanation, fairness in collaborative filtering and recommendation to groups of users.      
### 109.Automatic Recall Machines: Internal Replay, Continual Learning and the Brain  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12323.pdf)
>  Replay in neural networks involves training on sequential data with memorized samples, which counteracts forgetting of previous behavior caused by non-stationarity. We present a method where these auxiliary samples are generated on the fly, given only the model that is being trained for the assessed objective, without extraneous buffers or generator networks. Instead the implicit memory of learned samples within the assessed model itself is exploited. Furthermore, whereas existing work focuses on reinforcing the full seen data distribution, we show that optimizing for not forgetting calls for the generation of samples that are specialized to each real training batch, which is more efficient and scalable. We consider high-level parallels with the brain, notably the use of a single model for inference and recall, the dependency of recalled samples on the current environment batch, top-down modulation of activations and learning, abstract recall, and the dependency between the degree to which a task is learned and the degree to which it is recalled. These characteristics emerge naturally from the method without being controlled for.      
### 110.HookNet: multi-resolution convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation in histopathology whole-slide images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12230.pdf)
>  We propose HookNet, a semantic segmentation model for histopathology whole-slide images, which combines context and details via multiple branches of encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks. Concentricpatches at multiple resolutions with different fields of view are used to feed different branches of HookNet, and intermediate representations are combined via a hooking mechanism. We describe a framework to design and train HookNet for achieving high-resolution semantic segmentation and introduce constraints to guarantee pixel-wise alignment in feature maps during hooking. We show the advantages of using HookNet in two histopathology image segmentation tasks where tissue type prediction accuracy strongly depends on contextual information, namely (1) multi-class tissue segmentation in breast cancer and, (2) segmentation of tertiary lymphoid structures and germinal centers in lung cancer. Weshow the superiority of HookNet when compared with single-resolution U-Net models working at different resolutions as well as with a recently published multi-resolution model for histopathology image segmentation      
### 111.Learning Diagnosis of COVID-19 from a Single Radiological Image  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12220.pdf)
>  Radiological image is currently adopted as the visual evidence for COVID-19 diagnosis in clinical. Using deep models to realize automated infection measurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on radiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset (2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19 diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

### 112.Thermal vulnerability detection in integrated electronic and photonic circuits using IR thermography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12201.pdf)
>  Failure prediction of any electrical/optical component is crucial for estimating its operating life. Using high temperature operating life (HTOL) tests, it is possible to model the failure mechanisms for integrated circuits. Conventional HTOL standards are not suitable for operating life prediction of photonic components owing to their functional dependence on thermo-optic effect. This work presents an IR-assisted thermal vulnerability detection technique suitable for photonic as well as electronic components. By accurately mapping the thermal profile of an integrated circuit under a stress condition, it is possible to precisely locate the heat center for predicting the long-term operational failures within the device under test. For the first time, the reliability testing is extended to a fully functional microwave photonic system using conventional IR thermography. By applying image fusion using affine transformation on multimodal acquisition, it was demonstrated that by comparing the IR profile and GDSII layout, it is possible to accurately locate the heat centers along with spatial information on the type of component. Multiple IR profiles of optical as well as electrical components/circuits were acquired and mapped onto the layout files. In order to ascertain the degree of effectiveness of the proposed technique, IR profiles of CMOS RF and digital circuits were also analyzed. The presented technique offers a reliable automated identification of heat spots within a circuit/system.      
### 113.Neural networks adapting to datasets: learning network size and topology  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12195.pdf)
>  We introduce a flexible setup allowing for a neural network to learn both its size and topology during the course of a standard gradient-based training. The resulting network has the structure of a graph tailored to the particular learning task and dataset. The obtained networks can also be trained from scratch and achieve virtually identical performance. We explore the properties of the network architectures for a number of datasets of varying difficulty observing systematic regularities. The obtained graphs can be therefore understood as encoding nontrivial characteristics of the particular classification tasks.      
### 114.Neural Cellular Automata Manifold  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12155.pdf)
>  Very recently, a deep Neural Cellular Automata (NCA)[1] has been proposed to simulate the complex morphogenesis process with deep networks. This model learns to grow an image starting from a fixed single pixel. In this paper, we move a step further and propose a new model that extends the expressive power of NCA from a single image to an manifold of images. In biological terms, our approach would play the role of the transcription factors, modulating the mapping of genes into specific proteins that drive cellular differentiation, which occurs right before the morphogenesis. We accomplish this by introducing dynamic convolutions inside an Auto-Encoder architecture, for the first time used to join two different sources of information, the encoding and cell's environment information. The proposed model also extends the capabilities of the NCA to a general purpose network, which can be used in a broad range of problems. We thoroughly evaluate our approach in a dataset of synthetic emojis and also in real images of CIFAR-10.      
### 115.Learning to Generate Noise for Robustness against Multiple Perturbations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12135.pdf)
>  Adversarial learning has emerged as one of the successful techniques to circumvent the susceptibility of existing methods against adversarial perturbations. However, the majority of existing defense methods are tailored to defend against a single category of adversarial perturbation (e.g. $\ell_\infty$-attack). In safety-critical applications, this makes these methods extraneous as the attacker can adopt diverse adversaries to deceive the system. To tackle this challenge of robustness against multiple perturbations, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that explicitly learns to generate noise to improve the model's robustness against multiple types of attacks. Specifically, we propose Meta Noise Generator (MNG) that outputs optimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps lower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. However, training on multiple perturbations simultaneously significantly increases the computational overhead during training. To address this issue, we train our MNG while randomly sampling an attack at each epoch, which incurs negligible overhead over standard adversarial training. We validate the robustness of our framework on various datasets and against a wide variety of unseen perturbations, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms the relevant baselines across multiple perturbations with marginal computational cost compared to the multiple perturbations training.      
### 116.Deep Low-rank Prior in Dynamic MR Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.12090.pdf)
>  The deep learning methods have achieved attractive results in dynamic MR imaging. However, all of these methods only utilize the sparse prior of MR images, while the important low-rank (LR) prior of dynamic MR images is not explored, which limits further improvements of dynamic MR reconstruction. In this paper, we explore deep low-rank prior in dynamic MR imaging to obtain improved reconstruction results. In particular, we propose two novel and distinct schemes to introduce deep low-rank prior into deep network architectures in an unrolling manner and a plug-and-play manner respectively. In the unrolling manner, we propose a model-based unrolling sparse and low-rank network for dynamic MR imaging, dubbed SLR-Net. The SLR-Net is defined over a deep network flow graphs, which is unrolled from the iterative procedures in Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a sparse and low-rank based dynamic MRI model. In the plug-and-play manner, we propose a plug-and-play LR network module that can be easily embedded into any other dynamic MR neural networks without changing the neural network paradigm. Experimental results show that both of the two schemes can significantly improve the reconstruction results, no matter qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 117.Computational Enhancement of Molecularly Targeted Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound: Application to Human Breast Tumor Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11993.pdf)
>  Molecularly targeted contrast enhanced ultrasound (mCEUS) is a clinically promising approach for early cancer detection through targeted imaging of VEGFR2 (KDR) receptors. We have developed computational enhancement techniques for mCEUS tailored to address the unique challenges of imaging contrast accumulation in humans. These techniques utilize dynamic analysis to distinguish molecularly bound contrast agent from other contrast-mode signal sources, enabling analysis of contrast agent accumulation to be performed during contrast bolus arrival when the signal due to molecular binding is strongest. <br>Applied to the 18 human patient examinations of the first-in-human molecular ultrasound breast lesion study, computational enhancement improved the ability to differentiate between pathology-proven lesion and pathology-proven normal tissue in real-world human examination conditions that involved both patient and probe motion, with improvements in contrast ratio between lesion and normal tissue that in most cases exceed an order of magnitude (10x). Notably, computational enhancement eliminated a false positive result in which tissue leakage signal was misinterpreted by radiologists to be contrast agent accumulation.      
### 118.COVID-19 Image Data Collection: Prospective Predictions Are the Future  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11988.pdf)
>  Across the world's coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hot spots, the need to streamline patient diagnosis and management has become more pressing than ever. As one of the main imaging tools, chest X-rays (CXRs) are common, fast, non-invasive, relatively cheap, and potentially bedside to monitor the progression of the disease. This paper describes the first public COVID-19 image data collection as well as a preliminary exploration of possible use cases for the data. This dataset currently contains hundreds of frontal view X-rays and is the largest public resource for COVID-19 image and prognostic data, making it a necessary resource to develop and evaluate tools to aid in the treatment of COVID-19. It was manually aggregated from publication figures as well as various web based repositories into a machine learning (ML) friendly format with accompanying dataloader code. We collected frontal and lateral view imagery and metadata such as the time since first symptoms, intensive care unit (ICU) status, survival status, intubation status, or hospital location. We present multiple possible use cases for the data such as predicting the need for the ICU, predicting patient survival, and understanding a patient's trajectory during treatment.

### 119.ELF: An Early-Exiting Framework for Long-Tailed Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11979.pdf)
>  The natural world often follows a long-tailed data distribution where only a few classes account for most of the examples. This long-tail causes classifiers to overfit to the majority class. To mitigate this, prior solutions commonly adopt class rebalancing strategies such as data resampling and loss reshaping. However, by treating each example within a class equally, these methods fail to account for the important notion of example hardness, i.e., within each class some examples are easier to classify than others. To incorporate this notion of hardness into the learning process, we propose the EarLy-exiting Framework(ELF). During training, ELF learns to early-exit easy examples through auxiliary branches attached to a backbone network. This offers a dual benefit-(1) the neural network increasingly focuses on hard examples, since they contribute more to the overall network loss; and (2) it frees up additional model capacity to distinguish difficult examples. Experimental results on two large-scale datasets, ImageNet LT and iNaturalist'18, demonstrate that ELF can improve state-of-the-art accuracy by more than 3 percent. This comes with the additional benefit of reducing up to 20 percent of inference time FLOPS. ELF is complementary to prior work and can naturally integrate with a variety of existing methods to tackle the challenge of long-tailed distributions.      
### 120.FilterNet: A Neighborhood Relationship Enhanced Fully Convolutional Network for Calf Muscle Compartment Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11930.pdf)
>  Automated segmentation of individual calf muscle compartments from 3D magnetic resonance (MR) images is essential for developing quantitative biomarkers for muscular disease progression and its prediction. Achieving clinically acceptable results is a challenging task due to large variations in muscle shape and MR appearance. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) achieved improved accuracy in various image segmentation tasks, certain problems such as utilizing long-range information and incorporating high-level constraints remain unsolved. We present a novel fully convolutional network (FCN), called FilterNet, that utilizes contextual information in a large neighborhood and embeds edge-aware constraints for individual calf muscle compartment segmentations. An encoder-decoder architecture with flexible backbone blocks is used to systematically enlarge convolution receptive field and preserve information at all resolutions. Edge positions derived from the FCN output muscle probability maps are explicitly regularized using kernel-based edge detection in an end-to-end optimization framework. Our FilterNet was evaluated on 40 T1-weighted MR images of 10 healthy and 30 diseased subjects by 4-fold cross-validation. Mean DICE coefficients of 88.00%--91.29% and mean absolute surface positioning errors of 1.04--1.66 mm were achieved for the five 3D muscle compartments.      
### 121.Unsupervised Learning of Deep-Learned Features from Breast Cancer Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11843.pdf)
>  Detecting cancer manually in whole slide images requires significant time and effort on the laborious process. Recent advances in whole slide image analysis have stimulated the growth and development of machine learning-based approaches that improve the efficiency and effectiveness in the diagnosis of cancer diseases. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach for detecting cancer in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) whole slide images. The proposed method is fully automated and does not require human involvement during the unsupervised learning procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for cancer detection in BRCA and show how the machine can choose the most appropriate clusters during the unsupervised learning procedure. Moreover, we present a prototype application that enables users to select relevant groups mapping all regions related to the groups in whole slide images.      
### 122.Mapping Low-Resolution Images To Multiple High-Resolution Images Using Non-Adversarial Mapping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11708.pdf)
>  Several methods have recently been proposed for the Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) problem. The current methods assume that a single low-resolution image can only yield a single high-resolution image. In addition, all of these methods use low-resolution images that were artificially generated through simple bilinear down-sampling. We argue that, first and foremost, the problem of SISR is an one-to-many mapping problem between the low resolution and all possible candidate high-resolution images and we address the challenging task of learning how to realistically degrade and down-sample high-resolution images. To circumvent this problem, we propose SR-NAM which utilizes the Non-Adversarial Mapping (NAM) technique. Furthermore, we propose a degradation model that learns how to transform high-resolution images to low-resolution images that resemble realistically taken low-resolution photos. Finally, some qualitative results for the proposed method along with the weaknesses of SR-NAM are included.      
### 123.A Universal Representation Transformer Layer for Few-Shot Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11702.pdf)
>  Few-shot classification aims to recognize unseen classes when presented with only a small number of samples. We consider the problem of multi-domain few-shot image classification, where unseen classes and examples come from diverse data sources. This problem has seen growing interest and has inspired the development of benchmarks such as Meta-Dataset. A key challenge in this multi-domain setting is to effectively integrate the feature representations from the diverse set of training domains. Here, we propose a Universal Representation Transformer (URT) layer, that meta-learns to leverage universal features for few-shot classification by dynamically re-weighting and composing the most appropriate domain-specific representations. In experiments, we show that URT sets a new state-of-the-art result on Meta-Dataset. Specifically, it outperforms the best previous model on three data sources or performs the same in others. We analyze variants of URT and present a visualization of the attention score heatmaps that sheds light on how the model performs cross-domain generalization.

### 124.Towards Understanding Label Smoothing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11653.pdf)
>  Label smoothing regularization (LSR) has a great success in training deep neural networks by stochastic algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants. However, the theoretical understanding of its power from the view of optimization is still rare. This study opens the door to a deep understanding of LSR by initiating the analysis. In this paper, we analyze the convergence behaviors of stochastic gradient descent with LSR for solving non-convex problems and show that an appropriate LSR can help to speed up the convergence by reducing the variance of labels. More interestingly, we proposed a simple and efficient strategy, namely Two-Stage LAbel smoothing algorithm (TSLA), that uses LSR in the early training epochs and drops it off in the later training epochs. We observe from the improved convergence result of TSLA that it benefits from LSR in the first stage and essentially converges faster in the second stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for understanding the power of LSR via establishing convergence complexity of stochastic methods with LSR in non-convex optimization. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with baselines on training ResNet models over public data sets.      
### 125.Estimating Model Uncertainty of Neural Networks in Sparse Information Form  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11631.pdf)
>  We present a sparse representation of model uncertainty for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) where the parameter posterior is approximated with an inverse formulation of the Multivariate Normal Distribution (MND), also known as the information form. The key insight of our work is that the information matrix, i.e. the inverse of the covariance matrix tends to be sparse in its spectrum. Therefore, dimensionality reduction techniques such as low rank approximations (LRA) can be effectively exploited. To achieve this, we develop a novel sparsification algorithm and derive a cost-effective analytical sampler. As a result, we show that the information form can be scalably applied to represent model uncertainty in DNNs. Our exhaustive theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on various benchmarks show the competitiveness of our approach over the current methods.      
### 126.A Fast Stochastic Plug-and-Play ADMM for Imaging Inverse Problems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11630.pdf)
>  In this work we propose an efficient stochastic plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm for imaging inverse problems. The PnP stochastic gradient descent methods have been recently proposed and shown improved performance in some imaging applications over standard deterministic PnP methods. However, current stochastic PnP methods need to frequently compute the image denoisers which can be computationally expensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new stochastic PnP-ADMM method which is based on introducing stochastic gradient descent inner-loops within an inexact ADMM framework. We provide the theoretical guarantee on the fixed-point convergence for our algorithm under standard assumptions. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art PnP methods.      
### 127.One PLOT to Show Them All: Visualization of Efficient Sets in Multi-Objective Landscapes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11547.pdf)
>  Visualization techniques for the decision space of continuous multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) are rather scarce in research. For long, all techniques focused on global optimality and even for the few available landscape visualizations, e.g., cost landscapes, globality is the main criterion. In contrast, the recently proposed gradient field heatmaps (GFHs) emphasize the location and attraction basins of local efficient sets, but ignore the relation of sets in terms of solution quality. <br>In this paper, we propose a new and hybrid visualization technique, which combines the advantages of both approaches in order to represent local and global optimality together within a single visualization. Therefore, we build on the GFH approach but apply a new technique for approximating the location of locally efficient points and using the divergence of the multi-objective gradient vector field as a robust second-order condition. Then, the relative dominance relationship of the determined locally efficient points is used to visualize the complete landscape of the MOP. Augmented by information on the basins of attraction, this Plot of Landscapes with Optimal Trade-offs (PLOT) becomes one of the most informative multi-objective landscape visualization techniques available.      
### 128.On Addressing the Impact of ISO Speed upon PRNU and Forgery Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11539.pdf)
>  Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) has been used as a powerful device fingerprint for image forgery detection because image forgeries can be revealed by finding the absence of the PRNU in the manipulated areas. The correlation between an image's noise residual with the device's reference PRNU is often compared with a decision threshold to check the existence of the PRNU. A PRNU correlation predictor is usually used to determine this decision threshold assuming the correlation is content-dependent. However, we found that not only the correlation is content-dependent, but it also depends on the camera sensitivity setting. \textit{Camera sensitivity}, commonly known by the name of \textit{ISO speed}, is an important attribute in digital photography. In this work, we will show the PRNU correlation's dependency on ISO speed. Due to such dependency, we postulate that a correlation predictor is ISO speed-specific, i.e. \textit{reliable correlation predictions can only be made when a correlation predictor is trained with images of similar ISO speeds to the image in question}. We report the experiments we conducted to validate the postulate. It is realized that in the real-world, information about the ISO speed may not be available in the metadata to facilitate the implementation of our postulate in the correlation prediction process. We hence propose a method called Content-based Inference of ISO Speeds (CINFISOS) to infer the ISO speed from the image content.      
### 129.Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification with Deep Neural Networks in JPEG 2000 Compressed Domain  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11529.pdf)
>  To reduce the storage requirements, remote sensing (RS) images are usually stored in compressed format. Existing scene classification approaches using deep neural networks (DNNs) require to fully decompress the images, which is a computationally demanding task in operational applications. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel approach to achieve scene classification in JPEG 2000 compressed RS images. The proposed approach consists of two main steps: i) approximation of the finer resolution sub-bands of reversible biorthogonal wavelet filters used in JPEG 2000; and ii) characterization of the high-level semantic content of approximated wavelet sub-bands and scene classification based on the learnt descriptors. This is achieved by taking codestreams associated with the coarsest resolution wavelet sub-band as input to approximate finer resolution sub-bands using a number of transposed convolutional layers. Then, a series of convolutional layers models the high-level semantic content of the approximated wavelet sub-band. Thus, the proposed approach models the multiresolution paradigm given in the JPEG 2000 compression algorithm in an end-to-end trainable unified neural network. In the classification stage, the proposed approach takes only the coarsest resolution wavelet sub-bands as input, thereby reducing the time required to apply decoding. Experimental results performed on two benchmark aerial image archives demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the computational time with similar classification accuracies when compared to traditional RS scene classification approaches (which requires full image decompression).      
### 130.Neuro-Symbolic Visual Reasoning: Disentangling "Visual" from "Reasoning"  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11524.pdf)
>  Visual reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) require an interplay of visual perception with reasoning about the question semantics grounded in perception. Various benchmarks for reasoning across language and vision like VQA, VCR and more recently GQA for compositional question answering facilitate scientific progress from perception models to visual reasoning. However, recent advances are still primarily driven by perception improvements (e.g. scene graph generation) rather than reasoning. Neuro-symbolic models such as Neural Module Networks bring the benefits of compositional reasoning to VQA, but they are still entangled with visual representation learning, and thus neural reasoning is hard to improve and assess on its own. <br>To address this, we propose (1) a framework to isolate and evaluate the reasoning aspect of VQA separately from its perception, and (2) a novel top-down calibration technique that allows the model to answer reasoning questions even with imperfect perception. To this end, we introduce a differentiable first-order logic formalism for VQA that explicitly decouples question answering from visual perception. On the challenging GQA dataset, this approach is competitive with non-symbolic neural models while also interpretable by construction and composable with arbitrary pre-trained visual representation learning.      
### 131.Towards Adaptive Benthic Habitat Mapping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11453.pdf)
>  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly being used to support scientific research and monitoring studies. One such application is in benthic habitat mapping where these vehicles collect seafloor imagery that complements broadscale bathymetric data collected using sonar. Using these two data sources, the relationship between remotely-sensed acoustic data and the sampled imagery can be learned, creating a habitat model. As the areas to be mapped are often very large and AUV systems collecting seafloor imagery can only sample from a small portion of the survey area, the information gathered should be maximised for each deployment. This paper illustrates how the habitat models themselves can be used to plan more efficient AUV surveys by identifying where to collect further samples in order to most improve the habitat model. A Bayesian neural network is used to predict visually-derived habitat classes when given broad-scale bathymetric data. This network can also estimate the uncertainty associated with a prediction, which can be deconstructed into its aleatoric (data) and epistemic (model) components. We demonstrate how these structured uncertainty estimates can be utilised to improve the model with fewer samples. Such adaptive approaches to benthic surveys have the potential to reduce costs by prioritizing further sampling efforts. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using data collected by an AUV on offshore reefs in Tasmania, Australia.      
### 132.Capturing Video Frame Rate Variations through Entropic Differencing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11424.pdf)
>  High frame rate videos are increasingly getting popular in recent years majorly driven by strong requirements by the entertainment and streaming industries to provide high quality of experiences to consumers. To achieve the best trade-off between the bandwidth requirements and video quality in terms of frame rate adaptation, it is imperative to understand the effects of frame rate on video quality. In this direction, we make two contributions: firstly we design a High Frame Rate (HFR) video database consisting of 480 videos and around 19,000 human quality ratings. We then devise a novel statistical entropic differencing method based on Generalized Gaussian Distribution model in spatial and temporal band-pass domain, which measures the difference in quality between the reference and distorted videos. The proposed design is highly generalizable and can be employed when the reference and distorted sequences have different frame rates, without any need of temporal upsampling. We show through extensive experiments that our model correlates very well with subjective scores in the HFR database and achieves state of the art performance when compared with existing methodologies.      
### 133.A Multiparametric Class of Low-complexity Transforms for Image and Video Coding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11418.pdf)
>  Discrete transforms play an important role in many signal processing applications, and low-complexity alternatives for classical transforms became popular in recent years. Particularly, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) has proven to be convenient for data compression, being employed in well-known image and video coding standards such as JPEG, H.264, and the recent high efficiency video coding (HEVC). In this paper, we introduce a new class of low-complexity 8-point DCT approximations based on a series of works published by Bouguezel, Ahmed and Swamy. Also, a multiparametric fast algorithm that encompasses both known and novel transforms is derived. We select the best-performing DCT approximations after solving a multicriteria optimization problem, and submit them to a scaling method for obtaining larger size transforms. We assess these DCT approximations in both JPEG-like image compression and video coding experiments. We show that the optimal DCT approximations present compelling results in terms of coding efficiency and image quality metrics, and require only few addition or bit-shifting operations, being suitable for low-complexity and low-power systems.      
### 134.PraNet: Parallel Reverse Attention Network for Polyp Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11392.pdf)
>  Colonoscopy is an effective technique for detecting colorectal polyps, which are highly related to colorectal cancer. In clinical practice, segmenting polyps from colonoscopy images is of great importance since it provides valuable information for diagnosis and surgery. However, accurate polyp segmentation is a challenging task, for two major reasons: (i) the same type of polyps has a diversity of size, color and texture; and (ii) the boundary between a polyp and its surrounding mucosa is not sharp. To address these challenges, we propose a parallel reverse attention network (PraNet) for accurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. Specifically, we first aggregate the features in high-level layers using a parallel partial decoder (PPD). Based on the combined feature, we then generate a global map as the initial guidance area for the following components. In addition, we mine the boundary cues using a reverse attention (RA) module, which is able to establish the relationship between areas and boundary cues. Thanks to the recurrent cooperation mechanism between areas and boundaries, our PraNet is capable of calibrating any misaligned predictions, improving the segmentation accuracy. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on five challenging datasets across six metrics show that our PraNet improves the segmentation accuracy significantly, and presents a number of advantages in terms of generalizability, and real-time segmentation efficiency.      
### 135.Quantile-Quantile Embedding for Distribution Transformation, Manifold Embedding, and Image Embedding with Choice of Embedding Distribution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11385.pdf)
>  We propose a new embedding method, named Quantile-Quantile Embedding (QQE), for distribution transformation, manifold embedding, and image embedding with the ability to choose the embedding distribution. QQE, which uses the concept of quantile-quantile plot from visual statistical tests, can transform the distribution of data to any theoretical desired distribution or empirical reference sample. Moreover, QQE gives the user a choice of embedding distribution in embedding manifold of data into the low dimensional embedding space. It can also be used for modifying the embedding distribution of different dimensionality reduction methods, either basic or deep ones, for better representation or visualization of data. We propose QQE in both unsupervised and supervised manners. QQE can also transform the distribution to either the exact reference distribution or shape of the reference distribution; and one of its many applications is better discrimination of classes. Our experiments on different synthetic and image datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed embedding method.      
### 136.Normalization Matters in Zero-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11328.pdf)
>  An ability to grasp new concepts from their descriptions is one of the key features of human intelligence, and zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to incorporate this property into machine learning models. In this paper, we theoretically investigate two very popular tricks used in ZSL: "normalize+scale" trick and attributes normalization and show how they help to preserve a signal's variance in a typical model during a forward pass. Next, we demonstrate that these two tricks are not enough to normalize a deep ZSL network. We derive a new initialization scheme, which allows us to demonstrate strong state-of-the-art results on 4 out of 5 commonly used ZSL datasets: SUN, CUB, AwA1, and AwA2 while being on average 2 orders faster than the closest runner-up. Finally, we generalize ZSL to a broader problem -- Continual Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) and test our ideas in this new setup.

### 137.Self-Supervised Prototypical Transfer Learning for Few-Shot Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11325.pdf)
>  Most approaches in few-shot learning rely on costly annotated data related to the goal task domain during (pre-)training. Recently, unsupervised meta-learning methods have exchanged the annotation requirement for a reduction in few-shot classification performance. Simultaneously, in settings with realistic domain shift, common transfer learning has been shown to outperform supervised meta-learning. Building on these insights and on advances in self-supervised learning, we propose a transfer learning approach which constructs a metric embedding that clusters unlabeled prototypical samples and their augmentations closely together. This pre-trained embedding is a starting point for few-shot classification by summarizing class clusters and fine-tuning. We demonstrate that our self-supervised prototypical transfer learning approach ProtoTransfer outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised meta-learning methods on few-shot tasks from the mini-ImageNet dataset. In few-shot experiments with domain shift, our approach even has comparable performance to supervised methods, but requires orders of magnitude fewer labels.
