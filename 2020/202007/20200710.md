### 1.A Cordial Sync: Going Beyond Marginal Policies for Multi-Agent Embodied Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04979.pdf)
>  Autonomous agents must learn to collaborate. It is not scalable to develop a new centralized agent every time a task's difficulty outpaces a single agent's abilities. While multi-agent collaboration research has flourished in gridworld-like environments, relatively little work has considered visually rich domains. Addressing this, we introduce the novel task FurnMove in which agents work together to move a piece of furniture through a living room to a goal. Unlike existing tasks, FurnMove requires agents to coordinate at every timestep. We identify two challenges when training agents to complete FurnMove: existing decentralized action sampling procedures do not permit expressive joint action policies and, in tasks requiring close coordination, the number of failed actions dominates successful actions. To confront these challenges we introduce SYNC-policies (synchronize your actions coherently) and CORDIAL (coordination loss). Using SYNC-policies and CORDIAL, our agents achieve a 58% completion rate on FurnMove, an impressive absolute gain of 25 percentage points over competitive decentralized baselines. Our dataset, code, and pretrained models are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://unnat.github.io/cordial-sync" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> .      
### 2.Novel Subtypes of Pulmonary Emphysema Based on Spatially-Informed Lung Texture Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04978.pdf)
>  Pulmonary emphysema overlaps considerably with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is traditionally subcategorized into three subtypes previously identified on autopsy. Unsupervised learning of emphysema subtypes on computed tomography (CT) opens the way to new definitions of emphysema subtypes and eliminates the need of thorough manual labeling. However, CT-based emphysema subtypes have been limited to texture-based patterns without considering spatial location. In this work, we introduce a standardized spatial mapping of the lung for quantitative study of lung texture location, and propose a novel framework for combining spatial and texture information to discover spatially-informed lung texture patterns (sLTPs) that represent novel emphysema subtypes. Exploiting two cohorts of full-lung CT scans from the MESA COPD and EMCAP studies, we first show that our spatial mapping enables population-wide study of emphysema spatial location. We then evaluate the characteristics of the sLTPs discovered on MESA COPD, and show that they are reproducible, able to encode standard emphysema subtypes, and associated with physiological symptoms.      
### 3.Improving Style-Content Disentanglement in Image-to-Image Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04964.pdf)
>  Unsupervised image-to-image translation methods have achieved tremendous success in recent years. However, it can be easily observed that their models contain significant entanglement which often hurts the translation performance. In this work, we propose a principled approach for improving style-content disentanglement in image-to-image translation. By considering the information flow into each of the representations, we introduce an additional loss term which serves as a content-bottleneck. We show that the results of our method are significantly more disentangled than those produced by current methods, while further improving the visual quality and translation diversity.      
### 4.ThreeDWorld: A Platform for Interactive Multi-Modal Physical Simulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04954.pdf)
>  We introduce ThreeDWorld (TDW), a platform for interactive multi-modal physical simulation. With TDW, users can simulate high-fidelity sensory data and physical interactions between mobile agents and objects in a wide variety of rich 3D environments. TDW has several unique properties: 1) realtime near photo-realistic image rendering quality; 2) a library of objects and environments with materials for high-quality rendering, and routines enabling user customization of the asset library; 3) generative procedures for efficiently building classes of new environments 4) high-fidelity audio rendering; 5) believable and realistic physical interactions for a wide variety of material types, including cloths, liquid, and deformable objects; 6) a range of "avatar" types that serve as embodiments of AI agents, with the option for user avatar customization; and 7) support for human interactions with VR devices. TDW also provides a rich API enabling multiple agents to interact within a simulation and return a range of sensor and physics data representing the state of the world. We present initial experiments enabled by the platform around emerging research directions in computer vision, machine learning, and cognitive science, including multi-modal physical scene understanding, multi-agent interactions, models that "learn like a child", and attention studies in humans and neural networks. The simulation platform will be made publicly available.      
### 5.AI Assisted Apparel Design  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04950.pdf)
>  Fashion is a fast-changing industry where designs are refreshed at large scale every season. Moreover, it faces huge challenge of unsold inventory as not all designs appeal to customers. This puts designers under significant pressure. Firstly, they need to create innumerous fresh designs. Secondly, they need to create designs that appeal to customers. Although we see advancements in approaches to help designers analyzing consumers, often such insights are too many. Creating all possible designs with those insights is time consuming. In this paper, we propose a system of AI assistants that assists designers in their design journey. The proposed system assists designers in analyzing different selling/trending attributes of apparels. We propose two design generation assistants namely Apparel-Style-Merge and Apparel-Style-Transfer. Apparel-Style-Merge generates new designs by combining high level components of apparels whereas Apparel-Style-Transfer generates multiple customization of apparels by applying different styles, colors and patterns. We compose a new dataset, named DeepAttributeStyle, with fine-grained annotation of landmarks of different apparel components such as neck, sleeve etc. The proposed system is evaluated on a user group consisting of people with and without design background. Our evaluation result demonstrates that our approach generates high quality designs that can be easily used in fabrication. Moreover, the suggested designs aid to the designers creativity.      
### 6.Real-time Embedded Person Detection and Tracking for Shopping Behaviour Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04942.pdf)
>  Shopping behaviour analysis through counting and tracking of people in shop-like environments offers valuable information for store operators and provides key insights in the stores layout (e.g. frequently visited spots). Instead of using extra staff for this, automated on-premise solutions are preferred. These automated systems should be cost-effective, preferably on lightweight embedded hardware, work in very challenging situations (e.g. handling occlusions) and preferably work real-time. We solve this challenge by implementing a real-time TensorRT optimized YOLOv3-based pedestrian detector, on a Jetson TX2 hardware platform. By combining the detector with a sparse optical flow tracker we assign a unique ID to each customer and tackle the problem of loosing partially occluded customers. Our detector-tracker based solution achieves an average precision of 81.59% at a processing speed of 10 FPS. Besides valuable statistics, heat maps of frequently visited spots are extracted and used as an overlay on the video stream.      
### 7.The Phong Surface: Efficient 3D Model Fitting using Lifted Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04940.pdf)
>  Realtime perceptual and interaction capabilities in mixed reality require a range of 3D tracking problems to be solved at low latency on resource-constrained hardware such as head-mounted devices. Indeed, for devices such as HoloLens 2 where the CPU and GPU are left available for applications, multiple tracking subsystems are required to run on a continuous, real-time basis while sharing a single Digital Signal Processor. To solve model-fitting problems for HoloLens 2 hand tracking, where the computational budget is approximately 100 times smaller than an iPhone 7, we introduce a new surface model: the `Phong surface'. Using ideas from computer graphics, the Phong surface describes the same 3D shape as a triangulated mesh model, but with continuous surface normals which enable the use of lifting-based optimization, providing significant efficiency gains over ICP-based methods. We show that Phong surfaces retain the convergence benefits of smoother surface models, while triangle meshes do not.      
### 8.Anyone here? Smart embedded low-resolution omnidirectional video sensor to measure room occupancy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04934.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a room occupancy sensing solution with unique properties: (i) It is based on an omnidirectional vision camera, capturing rich scene info over a wide angle, enabling to count the number of people in a room and even their position. (ii) Although it uses a camera-input, no privacy issues arise because its extremely low image resolution, rendering people unrecognisable. (iii) The neural network inference is running entirely on a low-cost processing platform embedded in the sensor, reducing the privacy risk even further. (iv) Limited manual data annotation is needed, because of the self-training scheme we propose. Such a smart room occupancy rate sensor can be used in e.g. meeting rooms and flex-desks. Indeed, by encouraging flex-desking, the required office space can be reduced significantly. In some cases, however, a flex-desk that has been reserved remains unoccupied without an update in the reservation system. A similar problem occurs with meeting rooms, which are often under-occupied. By optimising the occupancy rate a huge reduction in costs can be achieved. Therefore, in this paper, we develop such system which determines the number of people present in office flex-desks and meeting rooms. Using an omnidirectional camera mounted in the ceiling, combined with a person detector, the company can intelligently update the reservation system based on the measured occupancy. Next to the optimisation and embedded implementation of such a self-training omnidirectional people detection algorithm, in this work we propose a novel approach that combines spatial and temporal image data, improving performance of our system on extreme low-resolution images.      
### 9.Single architecture and multiple task deep neural network for altered fingerprint analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04931.pdf)
>  Fingerprints are one of the most copious evidence in a crime scene and, for this reason, they are frequently used by law enforcement for identification of individuals. But fingerprints can be altered. "Altered fingerprints", refers to intentionally damage of the friction ridge pattern and they are often used by smart criminals in hope to evade law enforcement. We use a deep neural network approach training an Inception-v3 architecture. This paper proposes a method for detection of altered fingerprints, identification of types of alterations and recognition of gender, hand and fingers. We also produce activation maps that show which part of a fingerprint the neural network has focused on, in order to detect where alterations are positioned. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 98.21%, 98.46%, 92.52%, 97.53% and 92,18% for the classification of fakeness, alterations, gender, hand and fingers, respectively on the SO.CO.FING. dataset.      
### 10.Patient-Specific Domain Adaptation for Fast Optical Flow Based on Teacher-Student Knowledge Transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04928.pdf)
>  Fast motion feedback is crucial in computer-aided surgery (CAS) on moving tissue. Image-assistance in safety-critical vision applications requires a dense tracking of tissue motion. This can be done using optical flow (OF). Accurate motion predictions at high processing rates lead to higher patient safety. Current deep learning OF models show the common speed vs. accuracy trade-off. To achieve high accuracy at high processing rates, we propose patient-specific fine-tuning of a fast model. This minimizes the domain gap between training and application data, while reducing the target domain to the capability of the lower complex, fast model. We propose to obtain training sequences pre-operatively in the operation room. We handle missing ground truth, by employing teacher-student learning. Using flow estimations from teacher model FlowNet2 we specialize a fast student model FlowNet2S on the patient-specific domain. Evaluation is performed on sequences from the Hamlyn dataset. Our student model shows very good performance after fine-tuning. Tracking accuracy is comparable to the teacher model at a speed up of factor six. Fine-tuning can be performed within minutes, making it feasible for the operation room. Our method allows to use a real-time capable model that was previously not suited for this task. This method is laying the path for improved patient-specific motion estimation in CAS.      
### 11.Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Residual Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04905.pdf)
>  Uncertainty quantification is an important and challenging problem in deep learning. Previous methods rely on dropout layers which are not present in modern deep architectures or batch normalization which is sensitive to batch sizes. In this work, we address the problem of uncertainty quantification in deep residual networks by using a regularization technique called stochastic depth. We show that training residual networks using stochastic depth can be interpreted as a variational approximation to the intractable posterior over the weights in Bayesian neural networks. We demonstrate that by sampling from a distribution of residual networks with varying depth and shared weights, meaningful uncertainty estimates can be obtained. Moreover, compared to the original formulation of residual networks, our method produces well-calibrated softmax probabilities with only minor changes to the network's structure. We evaluate our approach on popular computer vision datasets and measure the quality of uncertainty estimates. We also test the robustness to domain shift and show that our method is able to express higher predictive uncertainty on out-of-distribution samples. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed approach could be used to obtain uncertainty estimates in facial verification applications.      
### 12.Cross-Modal Weighting Network for RGB-D Salient Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04901.pdf)
>  Depth maps contain geometric clues for assisting Salient Object Detection (SOD). In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Weighting (CMW) strategy to encourage comprehensive interactions between RGB and depth channels for RGB-D SOD. Specifically, three RGB-depth interaction modules, named CMW-L, CMW-M and CMW-H, are developed to deal with respectively low-, middle- and high-level cross-modal information fusion. These modules use Depth-to-RGB Weighing (DW) and RGB-to-RGB Weighting (RW) to allow rich cross-modal and cross-scale interactions among feature layers generated by different network blocks. To effectively train the proposed Cross-Modal Weighting Network (CMWNet), we design a composite loss function that summarizes the errors between intermediate predictions and ground truth over different scales. With all these novel components working together, CMWNet effectively fuses information from RGB and depth channels, and meanwhile explores object localization and details across scales. Thorough evaluations demonstrate CMWNet consistently outperforms 15 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods on seven popular benchmarks.      
### 13.PIE-NET: Parametric Inference of Point Cloud Edges  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04883.pdf)
>  We introduce an end-to-end learnable technique to robustly identify feature edges in 3D point cloud data. We represent these edges as a collection of parametric curves (i.e.,lines, circles, and B-splines). Accordingly, our deep neural network, coined PIE-NET, is trained for parametric inference of edges. The network relies on a "region proposal" architecture, where a first module proposes an over-complete collection of edge and corner points, and a second module ranks each proposal to decide whether it should be considered. We train and evaluate our method on the ABC dataset, a large dataset of CAD models, and compare our results to those produced by traditional (non-learning) processing pipelines, as well as a recent deep learning based edge detector (EC-NET). Our results significantly improve over the state-of-the-art from both a quantitative and qualitative standpoint.      
### 14.A Deep Joint Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization Framework for Identifying the Common and Subject-specific Functional Units of Tongue Motion During Speech  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04865.pdf)
>  Intelligible speech is produced by creating varying internal local muscle groupings---i.e., functional units---that are generated in a systematic and coordinated manner. There are two major challenges in characterizing and analyzing functional units. First, due to the complex and convoluted nature of tongue structure and function, it is of great importance to develop a method that can accurately decode complex muscle coordination patterns during speech. Second, it is challenging to keep identified functional units across subjects comparable due to their substantial variability. In this work, to address these challenges, we develop a new deep learning framework to identify common and subject-specific functional units of tongue motion during speech. Our framework hinges on joint deep graph-regularized sparse non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) using motion quantities derived from displacements by tagged Magnetic Resonance Imaging. More specifically, we transform NMF with sparse and manifold regularizations into modular architectures akin to deep neural networks by means of unfolding the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm to learn interpretable building blocks and associated weighting map. We then apply spectral clustering to common and subject-specific functional units. Experiments carried out with simulated datasets show that the proposed method surpasses the comparison methods. Experiments carried out with in vivo tongue motion datasets show that the proposed method can determine the common and subject-specific functional units with increased interpretability and decreased size variability.      
### 15.Statistical shape analysis of brain arterial networks (BAN)  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04793.pdf)
>  Structures of brain arterial networks (BANs) - that are complex arrangements of individual arteries, their branching patterns, and inter-connectivities - play an important role in characterizing and understanding brain physiology. One would like tools for statistically analyzing the shapes of BANs, i.e. quantify shape differences, compare population of subjects, and study the effects of covariates on these shapes. This paper mathematically represents and statistically analyzes BAN shapes as elastic shape graphs. Each elastic shape graph is made up of nodes that are connected by a number of 3D curves, and edges, with arbitrary shapes. We develop a mathematical representation, a Riemannian metric and other geometrical tools, such as computations of geodesics, means and covariances, and PCA for analyzing elastic graphs and BANs. This analysis is applied to BANs after separating them into four components -- top, bottom, left, and right. This framework is then used to generate shape summaries of BANs from 92 subjects, and to study the effects of age and gender on shapes of BAN components. We conclude that while gender effects require further investigation, the age has a clear, quantifiable effect on BAN shapes. Specifically, we find an increased variance in BAN shapes as age increases.      
### 16.Generalized Many-Way Few-Shot Video Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04755.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning methods operate in low data regimes. The aim is to learn with few training examples per class. Although significant progress has been made in few-shot image classification, few-shot video recognition is relatively unexplored and methods based on 2D CNNs are unable to learn temporal information. In this work we thus develop a simple 3D CNN baseline, surpassing existing methods by a large margin. To circumvent the need of labeled examples, we propose to leverage weakly-labeled videos from a large dataset using tag retrieval followed by selecting the best clips with visual similarities, yielding further improvement. Our results saturate current 5-way benchmarks for few-shot video classification and therefore we propose a new challenging benchmark involving more classes and a mixture of classes with varying supervision.      
### 17.Animated GIF optimization by adaptive color local table management  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04717.pdf)
>  After thirty years of the GIF file format, today is becoming more popular than ever: being a great way of communication for friends and communities on Instant Messengers and Social Networks. While being so popular, the original compression method to encode GIF images have not changed a bit. On the other hand popularity means that storage saving becomes an issue for hosting platforms. In this paper a parametric optimization technique for animated GIFs will be presented. The proposed technique is based on Local Color Table selection and color remapping in order to create optimized animated GIFs while preserving the original format. The technique achieves good results in terms of byte reduction with limited or no loss of perceived color quality. Tests carried out on 1000 GIF files demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization strategy.      
### 18.Pollen13K: A Large Scale Microscope Pollen Grain Image Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04690.pdf)
>  Pollen grain classification has a remarkable role in many fields from medicine to biology and agronomy. Indeed, automatic pollen grain classification is an important task for all related applications and areas. This work presents the first large-scale pollen grain image dataset, including more than 13 thousands objects. After an introduction to the problem of pollen grain classification and its motivations, the paper focuses on the employed data acquisition steps, which include aerobiological sampling, microscope image acquisition, object detection, segmentation and labelling. Furthermore, a baseline experimental assessment for the task of pollen classification on the built dataset, together with discussion on the achieved results, is presented.      
### 19.Not only Look, but also Listen: Learning Multimodal Violence Detection under Weak Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04687.pdf)
>  Violence detection has been studied in computer vision for years. However, previous work are either superficial, e.g., classification of short-clips, and the single scenario, or undersupplied, e.g., the single modality, and hand-crafted features based multimodality. To address this problem, in this work we first release a large-scale and multi-scene dataset named XD-Violence with a total duration of 217 hours, containing 4754 untrimmed videos with audio signals and weak labels. Then we propose a neural network containing three parallel branches to capture different relations among video snippets and integrate features, where holistic branch captures long-range dependencies using similarity prior, localized branch captures local positional relation using proximity prior, and score branch dynamically captures the closeness of predicted score. Besides, our method also includes an approximator to meet the needs of online detection. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on our released dataset and other existing benchmark. Moreover, extensive experimental results also show the positive effect of multimodal input and modeling relationships. The code and dataset will be released in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://roc-ng.github.io/XD-Violence/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 20.How low can you go? Privacy-preserving people detection with an omni-directional camera  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04678.pdf)
>  In this work, we use a ceiling-mounted omni-directional camera to detect people in a room. This can be used as a sensor to measure the occupancy of meeting rooms and count the amount of flex-desk working spaces available. If these devices can be integrated in an embedded low-power sensor, it would form an ideal extension of automated room reservation systems in office environments. The main challenge we target here is ensuring the privacy of the people filmed. The approach we propose is going to extremely low image resolutions, such that it is impossible to recognise people or read potentially confidential documents. Therefore, we retrained a single-shot low-resolution person detection network with automatically generated ground truth. In this paper, we prove the functionality of this approach and explore how low we can go in resolution, to determine the optimal trade-off between recognition accuracy and privacy preservation. Because of the low resolution, the result is a lightweight network that can potentially be deployed on embedded hardware. Such embedded implementation enables the development of a decentralised smart camera which only outputs the required meta-data (i.e. the number of persons in the meeting room).      
### 21.Automated analysis of eye-tracker-based human-human interaction studies  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04671.pdf)
>  Mobile eye-tracking systems have been available for about a decade now and are becoming increasingly popular in different fields of application, including marketing, sociology, usability studies and linguistics. While the user-friendliness and ergonomics of the hardware are developing at a rapid pace, the software for the analysis of mobile eye-tracking data in some points still lacks robustness and functionality. With this paper, we investigate which state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms may be used to automate the post-analysis of mobile eye-tracking data. For the case study in this paper, we focus on mobile eye-tracker recordings made during human-human face-to-face interactions. We compared two recent publicly available frameworks (YOLOv2 and OpenPose) to relate the gaze location generated by the eye-tracker to the head and hands visible in the scene camera data. In this paper we will show that the use of this single-pipeline framework provides robust results, which are both more accurate and faster than previous work in the field. Moreover, our approach does not rely on manual interventions during this process.      
### 22.Building Robust Industrial Applicable Object Detection Models Using Transfer Learning and Single Pass Deep Learning Architectures  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04666.pdf)
>  The uprising trend of deep learning in computer vision and artificial intelligence can simply not be ignored. On the most diverse tasks, from recognition and detection to segmentation, deep learning is able to obtain state-of-the-art results, reaching top notch performance. In this paper we explore how deep convolutional neural networks dedicated to the task of object detection can improve our industrial-oriented object detection pipelines, using state-of-the-art open source deep learning frameworks, like Darknet. By using a deep learning architecture that integrates region proposals, classification and probability estimation in a single run, we aim at obtaining real-time performance. We focus on reducing the needed amount of training data drastically by exploring transfer learning, while still maintaining a high average precision. Furthermore we apply these algorithms to two industrially relevant applications, one being the detection of promotion boards in eye tracking data and the other detecting and recognizing packages of warehouse products for augmented advertisements.      
### 23.The autonomous hidden camera crew  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04657.pdf)
>  Reality TV shows that follow people in their day-to-day lives are not a new concept. However, the traditional methods used in the industry require a lot of manual labour and need the presence of at least one physical camera man. Because of this, the subjects tend to behave differently when they are aware of being recorded. This paper will present an approach to follow people in their day-to-day lives, for long periods of time (months to years), while being as unobtrusive as possible. To do this, we use unmanned cinematographically-aware cameras hidden in people's houses. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: First, we create a system to limit the amount of recorded data by intelligently controlling a video switch matrix, in combination with a multi-channel recorder. Second, we create a virtual camera man by controlling a PTZ camera to automatically make cinematographically pleasing shots. Throughout this paper, we worked closely with a real camera crew. This enabled us to compare the results of our system to the work of trained professionals.      
### 24.Inertial Measurements for Motion Compensation in Weight-bearing Cone-beam CT of the Knee  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04655.pdf)
>  Involuntary motion during weight-bearing cone-beam computed tomography (CT) scans of the knee causes artifacts in the reconstructed volumes making them unusable for clinical diagnosis. Currently, image-based or marker-based methods are applied to correct for this motion, but often require long execution or preparation times. We propose to attach an inertial measurement unit (IMU) containing an accelerometer and a gyroscope to the leg of the subject in order to measure the motion during the scan and correct for it. To validate this approach, we present a simulation study using real motion measured with an optical 3D tracking system. With this motion, an XCAT numerical knee phantom is non-rigidly deformed during a simulated CT scan creating motion corrupted projections. A biomechanical model is animated with the same tracked motion in order to generate measurements of an IMU placed below the knee. In our proposed multi-stage algorithm, these signals are transformed to the global coordinate system of the CT scan and applied for motion compensation during reconstruction. Our proposed approach can effectively reduce motion artifacts in the reconstructed volumes. Compared to the motion corrupted case, the average structural similarity index and root mean squared error with respect to the no-motion case improved by 13-21% and 68-70%, respectively. These results are qualitatively and quantitatively on par with a state-of-the-art marker-based method we compared our approach to. The presented study shows the feasibility of this novel approach, and yields promising results towards a purely IMU-based motion compensation in C-arm CT.      
### 25.Maximum Entropy Regularization and Chinese Text Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04651.pdf)
>  Chinese text recognition is more challenging than Latin text due to the large amount of fine-grained Chinese characters and the great imbalance over classes, which causes a serious overfitting problem. We propose to apply Maximum Entropy Regularization to regularize the training process, which is to simply add a negative entropy term to the canonical cross-entropy loss without any additional parameters and modification of a model. We theoretically give the convergence probability distribution and analyze how the regularization influence the learning process. Experiments on Chinese character recognition, Chinese text line recognition and fine-grained image classification achieve consistent improvement, proving that the regularization is beneficial to generalization and robustness of a recognition model.      
### 26.JGR-P2O: Joint Graph Reasoning based Pixel-to-Offset Prediction Network for 3D Hand Pose Estimation from a Single Depth Image  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04646.pdf)
>  State-of-the-art single depth image-based 3D hand pose estimation methods are based on dense predictions, including voxel-to-voxel predictions, point-to-point regression, and pixel-wise estimations. Despite the good performance, those methods have a few issues in nature, such as the poor trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and plain feature representation learning with local convolutions. In this paper, a novel pixel-wise prediction-based method is proposed to address the above issues. The key ideas are two-fold: a) explicitly modeling the dependencies among joints and the relations between the pixels and the joints for better local feature representation learning; b) unifying the dense pixel-wise offset predictions and direct joint regression for end-to-end training. Specifically, we first propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based joint graph reasoning module to model the complex dependencies among joints and augment the representation capability of each pixel. Then we densely estimate all pixels' offsets to joints in both image plane and depth space and calculate the joints' positions by a weighted average over all pixels' predictions, totally discarding the complex postprocessing operations. The proposed model is implemented with an efficient 2D fully convolutional network (FCN) backbone and has only about 1.4M parameters. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D hand pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy while running very efficiently with around a speed of 110fps on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.      
### 27.ESA-ReID: Entropy-Based Semantic Feature Alignment for Person re-ID  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04644.pdf)
>  Person re-identification (re-ID) is a challenging task in real-world. Besides the typical application in surveillance system, re-ID also has significant values to improve the recall rate of people identification in content video (TV or Movies). However, the occlusion, shot angle variations and complicated background make it far away from application, especially in content video. In this paper we propose an entropy based semantic feature alignment model, which takes advantages of the detailed information of the human semantic feature. Considering the uncertainty of semantic segmentation, we introduce a semantic alignment with an entropy-based mask which can reduce the negative effects of mask segmentation errors. We construct a new re-ID dataset based on content videos with many cases of occlusion and body part missing, which will be released in future. Extensive studies on both existing datasets and the new dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.      
### 28.Attention Neural Network for Trash Detection on Water Channels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04639.pdf)
>  Rivers and canals flowing through cities are often used illegally for dumping the trash. This contaminates freshwater channels as well as causes blockage in sewerage resulting in urban flooding. When this contaminated water reaches agricultural fields, it results in degradation of soil and poses critical environmental as well as economic threats. The dumped trash is often found floating on the water surface. The trash could be disfigured, partially submerged, decomposed into smaller pieces, clumped together with other objects which obscure its shape and creates a challenging detection problem. This paper proposes a method for the detection of visible trash floating on the water surface of the canals in urban areas. We also provide a large dataset, first of its kind, trash in water channels that contains object-level annotations. A novel attention layer is proposed that improves the detection of smaller objects. Towards the end of this paper, we provide a detailed comparison of our method with state-of-the-art object detectors and show that our method significantly improves the detection of smaller objects. The dataset will be made publicly available.      
### 29.Monocular Vision based Crowdsourced 3D Traffic Sign Positioning with Unknown Camera Intrinsics and Distortion Coefficients  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04592.pdf)
>  Autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems utilize maps of 3D semantic landmarks for improved decision making. However, scaling the mapping process as well as regularly updating such maps come with a huge cost. Crowdsourced mapping of these landmarks such as traffic sign positions provides an appealing alternative. The state-of-the-art approaches to crowdsourced mapping use ground truth camera parameters, which may not always be known or may change over time. In this work, we demonstrate an approach to computing 3D traffic sign positions without knowing the camera focal lengths, principal point, and distortion coefficients a priori. We validate our proposed approach on a public dataset of traffic signs in KITTI. Using only a monocular color camera and GPS, we achieve an average single journey relative and absolute positioning accuracy of 0.26 m and 1.38 m, respectively.      
### 30.VisImages: A Large-scale, High-quality Image Corpus in Visualization Publications  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04584.pdf)
>  Images in visualization publications contain rich information, such as novel visual designs, model details, and experiment results. Constructing such an image corpus can contribute to the community in many aspects, including literature analysis from the perspective of visual representations, empirical studies on visual memorability, and machine learning research for chart detection. This study presents VisImages, a high-quality and large-scale image corpus collected from visualization publications. VisImages contain fruitful and diverse annotations for each image, including captions, types of visual representations, and bounding boxes. First, we algorithmically extract the images associated with captions and manually correct the errors. Second, to categorize visualizations in publications, we extend and iteratively refine the existing taxonomy through a multi-round pilot study. Third, guided by this taxonomy, we invite senior visualization practitioners to annotate visual representations that appear in each image. In this process, we borrow techniques such as "gold standards" and majority voting for quality control. Finally, we recruit the crowd to draw bounding boxes for visual representations in the images. The resulting corpus contains 35,096 annotated visualizations from 12,267 images with 12,057 captions in 1397 papers from VAST and InfoVis. We demonstrate the usefulness of VisImages through the following four use cases: 1) analysis of color usage in VAST and InfoVis papers across years, 2) discussion of the researcher preference on visualization types, 3) spatial distribution analysis of visualizations in visual analytic systems, and 4) training visualization detection models.      
### 31.Auxiliary Tasks Speed Up Learning PointGoal Navigation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04561.pdf)
>  PointGoal Navigation is an embodied task that requires agents to navigate to a specified point in an unseen environment. Wijmans et al. showed that this task is solvable but their method is computationally prohibitive, requiring 2.5 billion frames and 180 GPU-days. In this work, we develop a method to significantly increase sample and time efficiency in learning PointNav using self-supervised auxiliary tasks (e.g. predicting the action taken between two egocentric observations, predicting the distance between two observations from a trajectory,etc.).We find that naively combining multiple auxiliary tasks improves sample efficiency,but only provides marginal gains beyond a point. To overcome this, we use attention to combine representations learnt from individual auxiliary tasks. Our best agent is 5x faster to reach the performance of the previous state-of-the-art, DD-PPO, at 40M frames, and improves on DD-PPO's performance at40M frames by 0.16 SPL.

### 32.Alleviating the Burden of Labeling: Sentence Generation by Attention Branch Encoder-Decoder Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04557.pdf)
>  Domestic service robots (DSRs) are a promising solution to the shortage of home care workers. However, one of the main limitations of DSRs is their inability to interact naturally through language. Recently, data-driven approaches have been shown to be effective for tackling this limitation; however, they often require large-scale datasets, which is costly. Based on this background, we aim to perform automatic sentence generation of fetching instructions: for example, "Bring me a green tea bottle on the table." This is particularly challenging because appropriate expressions depend on the target object, as well as its surroundings. In this paper, we propose the attention branch encoder--decoder network (ABEN), to generate sentences from visual inputs. Unlike other approaches, the ABEN has multimodal attention branches that use subword-level attention and generate sentences based on subword embeddings. In experiments, we compared the ABEN with a baseline method using four standard metrics in image captioning. Results show that the ABEN outperformed the baseline in terms of these metrics.      
### 33.Long-Term Residual Blending Network for Blur Invariant Single Image Blind deblurring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04543.pdf)
>  We present a novel, blind, single image deblurring method that utilizes information regarding blur kernels. Our model solves the deblurring problem by dividing it into two successive tasks: (1) blur kernel estimation and (2) sharp image restoration. We first introduce a kernel estimation network that produces adaptive blur kernels based on the analysis of the blurred image. The network learns the blur pattern of the input image and trains to generate the estimation of image-specific blur kernels. Subsequently, we propose a long-term residual blending network that restores sharp images using the estimated blur kernel. To use the kernel efficiently, we propose a blending block that encodes features from both blurred images and blur kernels into a low dimensional space and then decodes them simultaneously to obtain an appropriately synthesized feature representation. We evaluate our model on REDS, GOPRO and Flickr2K datasets using various Gaussian blur kernels. Experiments show that our model can achieve excellent results on each dataset.      
### 34.EPI-based Oriented Relation Networks for Light Field Depth Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04538.pdf)
>  Light fields record not only the spatial information of observed scenes but also the directions of all incoming light rays. The spatial information and angular information implicitly contain the geometrical characteristics such as multi-view geometry or epipolar geometry, which can be exploited to improve the performance of depth estimation. Epipolar Plane Image (EPI), the unique 2D spatial-angular slice of the light field, contains patterns of oriented lines. The slope of these lines is associated with the disparity. Benefit from this property of EPIs, some representative methods estimate depth maps by analyzing the disparity of each line in EPIs. However, these methods often extract the optimal slope of the lines from EPIs while ignoring the relationship between neighboring pixels, which leads to inaccurate depth map predictions. Based on the observation that the similar linear structure between the oriented lines and their neighboring pixels, we propose an end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) to estimate the depth value of the intersection point on the horizontal and vertical EPIs. Specifically, we present a new feature extraction module, called Oriented Relation Module (ORM), that constructs the relationship between the line orientations. To facilitate training, we also propose a refocusing-based data augmentation method to obtain different slopes from EPIs of the same scene point. Extensive experiments verify the efficacy of learning relations and show that our approach is competitive to other state-of-the-art methods.      
### 35.Point Set Voting for Partial Point Cloud Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04537.pdf)
>  The continual improvement of 3D sensors has driven the development of algorithms to perform point cloud analysis. In fact, techniques for point cloud classification and segmentation have in recent years achieved incredible performance driven in part by leveraging large synthetic datasets. Unfortunately these same state-of-the-art approaches perform poorly when applied to incomplete point clouds. This limitation of existing algorithms is particularly concerning since point clouds generated by 3D sensors in the real world are usually incomplete due to perspective view or occlusion by other objects. This paper proposes a general model for partial point clouds analysis wherein the latent feature encoding a complete point clouds is inferred by applying a local point set voting strategy. In particular, each local point set constructs a vote that corresponds to a distribution in the latent space, and the optimal latent feature is the one with the highest probability. This approach ensures that any subsequent point cloud analysis is robust to partial observation while simultaneously guaranteeing that the proposed model is able to output multiple possible results. This paper illustrates that this proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on shape classification, part segmentation and point cloud completion.      
### 36.Attention-based Residual Speech Portrait Model for Speech to Face Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04536.pdf)
>  Given a speaker's speech, it is interesting to see if it is possible to generate this speaker's face. One main challenge in this task is to alleviate the natural mismatch between face and speech. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Attention-based Residual Speech Portrait Model (AR-SPM) by introducing the ideal of the residual into a hybrid encoder-decoder architecture, where face prior features are merged with the output of speech encoder to form the final face feature. In particular, we innovatively establish a tri-item loss function, which is a weighted linear combination of the L2-norm, L1-norm and negative cosine loss, to train our model by comparing the final face feature and true face feature. Evaluation on AVSpeech dataset shows that our proposed model accelerates the convergence of training, outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of quality of the generated face, and achieves superior recognition accuracy of gender and age compared with the ground truth.      
### 37.PointMask: Towards Interpretable and Bias-Resilient Point Cloud Processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04525.pdf)
>  Deep classifiers tend to associate a few discriminative input variables with their objective function, which in turn, may hurt their generalization capabilities. To address this, one can design systematic experiments and/or inspect the models via interpretability methods. In this paper, we investigate both of these strategies on deep models operating on point clouds. We propose PointMask, a model-agnostic interpretable information-bottleneck approach for attribution in point cloud models. PointMask encourages exploring the majority of variation factors in the input space while gradually converging to a general solution. More specifically, PointMask introduces a regularization term that minimizes the mutual information between the input and the latent features used to masks out irrelevant variables. We show that coupling a PointMask layer with an arbitrary model can discern the points in the input space which contribute the most to the prediction score, thereby leading to interpretability. Through designed bias experiments, we also show that thanks to its gradual masking feature, our proposed method is effective in handling data bias.      
### 38.Aligning Videos in Space and Time  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04515.pdf)
>  In this paper, we focus on the task of extracting visual correspondences across videos. Given a query video clip from an action class, we aim to align it with training videos in space and time. Obtaining training data for such a fine-grained alignment task is challenging and often ambiguous. Hence, we propose a novel alignment procedure that learns such correspondence in space and time via cross video cycle-consistency. During training, given a pair of videos, we compute cycles that connect patches in a given frame in the first video by matching through frames in the second video. Cycles that connect overlapping patches together are encouraged to score higher than cycles that connect non-overlapping patches. Our experiments on the Penn Action and Pouring datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully learn to correspond semantically similar patches across videos, and learns representations that are sensitive to object and action states.      
### 39.Deep Multi-task Learning for Facial Expression Recognition and Synthesis Based on Selective Feature Sharing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04514.pdf)
>  Multi-task learning is an effective learning strategy for deep-learning-based facial expression recognition tasks. However, most existing methods take into limited consideration the feature selection, when transferring information between different tasks, which may lead to task interference when training the multi-task networks. To address this problem, we propose a novel selective feature-sharing method, and establish a multi-task network for facial expression recognition and facial expression synthesis. The proposed method can effectively transfer beneficial features between different tasks, while filtering out useless and harmful information. Moreover, we employ the facial expression synthesis task to enlarge and balance the training dataset to further enhance the generalization ability of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on those commonly used facial expression recognition benchmarks, which makes it a potential solution to real-world facial expression recognition problems.      
### 40.Towards Unsupervised Learning for Instrument Segmentation in Robotic Surgery with Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04505.pdf)
>  Surgical tool segmentation in endoscopic images is an important problem: it is a crucial step towards full instrument pose estimation and it is used for integration of pre- and intra-operative images into the endoscopic view. While many recent approaches based on convolutional neural networks have shown great results, a key barrier to progress lies in the acquisition of a large number of manually-annotated images which is necessary for an algorithm to generalize and work well in diverse surgical scenarios. Unlike the surgical image data itself, annotations are difficult to acquire and may be of variable quality. On the other hand, synthetic annotations can be automatically generated by using forward kinematic model of the robot and CAD models of tools by projecting them onto an image plane. Unfortunately, this model is very inaccurate and cannot be used for supervised learning of image segmentation models. Since generated annotations will not directly correspond to endoscopic images due to errors, we formulate the problem as an unpaired image-to-image translation where the goal is to learn the mapping between an input endoscopic image and a corresponding annotation using an adversarial model. Our approach allows to train image segmentation models without the need to acquire expensive annotations and can potentially exploit large unlabeled endoscopic image collection outside the annotated distributions of image/annotation data. We test our proposed method on Endovis 2017 challenge dataset and show that it is competitive with supervised segmentation methods.      
### 41.Searching for Efficient Architecture for Instrument Segmentation in Robotic Surgery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04449.pdf)
>  Segmentation of surgical instruments is an important problem in robot-assisted surgery: it is a crucial step towards full instrument pose estimation and is directly used for masking of augmented reality overlays during surgical procedures. Most applications rely on accurate real-time segmentation of high-resolution surgical images. While previous research focused primarily on methods that deliver high accuracy segmentation masks, majority of them can not be used for real-time applications due to their computational cost. In this work, we design a light-weight and highly-efficient deep residual architecture which is tuned to perform real-time inference of high-resolution images. To account for reduced accuracy of the discovered light-weight deep residual network and avoid adding any additional computational burden, we perform a differentiable search over dilation rates for residual units of our network. We test our discovered architecture on the EndoVis 2017 Robotic Instruments dataset and verify that our model is the state-of-the-art in terms of speed and accuracy tradeoff with a speed of up to 125 FPS on high resolution images.      
### 42.IQ-VQA: Intelligent Visual Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04422.pdf)
>  Even though there has been tremendous progress in the field of Visual Question Answering, models today still tend to be inconsistent and brittle. To this end, we propose a model-independent cyclic framework which increases consistency and robustness of any VQA architecture. We train our models to answer the original question, generate an implication based on the answer and then also learn to answer the generated implication correctly. As a part of the cyclic framework, we propose a novel implication generator which can generate implied questions from any question-answer pair. As a baseline for future works on consistency, we provide a new human annotated VQA-Implications dataset. The dataset consists of ~30k questions containing implications of 3 types - Logical Equivalence, Necessary Condition and Mutual Exclusion - made from the VQA v2.0 validation dataset. We show that our framework improves consistency of VQA models by ~15% on the rule-based dataset, ~7% on VQA-Implications dataset and robustness by ~2%, without degrading their performance. In addition, we also quantitatively show improvement in attention maps which highlights better multi-modal understanding of vision and language.      
### 43.Quaternion Capsule Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04389.pdf)
>  Capsules are grouping of neurons that allow to represent sophisticated information of a visual entity such as pose and features. In the view of this property, Capsule Networks outperform CNNs in challenging tasks like object recognition in unseen viewpoints, and this is achieved by learning the transformations between the object and its parts with the help of high dimensional representation of pose information. In this paper, we present Quaternion Capsules (QCN) where pose information of capsules and their transformations are represented by quaternions. Quaternions are immune to the gimbal lock, have straightforward regularization of the rotation representation for capsules, and require less number of parameters than matrices. The experimental results show that QCNs generalize better to novel viewpoints with fewer parameters, and also achieve on-par or better performances with the state-of-the-art Capsule architectures on well-known benchmarking datasets.      
### 44.Words as Art Materials: Generating Paintings with Sequential GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04383.pdf)
>  Converting text descriptions into images using Generative Adversarial Networks has become a popular research area. Visually appealing images have been generated successfully in recent years. Inspired by these studies, we investigated the generation of artistic images on a large variance dataset. This dataset includes images with variations, for example, in shape, color, and content. These variations in images provide originality which is an important factor for artistic essence. One major characteristic of our work is that we used keywords as image descriptions, instead of sentences. As the network architecture, we proposed a sequential Generative Adversarial Network model. The first stage of this sequential model processes the word vectors and creates a base image whereas the next stages focus on creating high-resolution artistic-style images without working on word vectors. To deal with the unstable nature of GANs, we proposed a mixture of techniques like Wasserstein loss, spectral normalization, and minibatch discrimination. Ultimately, we were able to generate painting images, which have a variety of styles. We evaluated our results by using the Fréchet Inception Distance score and conducted a user study with 186 participants.      
### 45.Temporal aggregation of audio-visual modalities for emotion recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04364.pdf)
>  Emotion recognition has a pivotal role in affective computing and in human-computer interaction. The current technological developments lead to increased possibilities of collecting data about the emotional state of a person. In general, human perception regarding the emotion transmitted by a subject is based on vocal and visual information collected in the first seconds of interaction with the subject. As a consequence, the integration of verbal (i.e., speech) and non-verbal (i.e., image) information seems to be the preferred choice in most of the current approaches towards emotion recognition. In this paper, we propose a multimodal fusion technique for emotion recognition based on combining audio-visual modalities from a temporal window with different temporal offsets for each modality. We show that our proposed method outperforms other methods from the literature and human accuracy rating. The experiments are conducted over the open-access multimodal dataset CREMA-D.      
### 46.Sensor Fusion of Camera and Cloud Digital Twin Information for Intelligent Vehicles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04350.pdf)
>  With the rapid development of intelligent vehicles and Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), a mixed level of human driver engagements is involved in the transportation system. Visual guidance for drivers is essential under this situation to prevent potential risks. To advance the development of visual guidance systems, we introduce a novel sensor fusion methodology, integrating camera image and Digital Twin knowledge from the cloud. Target vehicle bounding box is drawn and matched by combining results of object detector running on ego vehicle and position information from the cloud. The best matching result, with a 79.2% accuracy under 0.7 Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold, is obtained with depth image served as an additional feature source. Game engine-based simulation results also reveal that the visual guidance system could improve driving safety significantly cooperate with the cloud Digital Twin system.      
### 47.Deep Placental Vessel Segmentation for Fetoscopic Mosaicking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04349.pdf)
>  During fetoscopic laser photocoagulation, a treatment for twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), the clinician first identifies abnormal placental vascular connections and laser ablates them to regulate blood flow in both fetuses. The procedure is challenging due to the mobility of the environment, poor visibility in amniotic fluid, occasional bleeding, and limitations in the fetoscopic field-of-view and image quality. Ideally, anastomotic placental vessels would be automatically identified, segmented and registered to create expanded vessel maps to guide laser ablation, however, such methods have yet to be clinically adopted. We propose a solution utilising the U-Net architecture for performing placental vessel segmentation in fetoscopic videos. The obtained vessel probability maps provide sufficient cues for mosaicking alignment by registering consecutive vessel maps using the direct intensity-based technique. Experiments on 6 different in vivo fetoscopic videos demonstrate that the vessel intensity-based registration outperformed image intensity-based registration approaches showing better robustness in qualitative and quantitative comparison. We additionally reduce drift accumulation to negligible even for sequences with up to 400 frames and we incorporate a scheme for quantifying drift error in the absence of the ground-truth. Our paper provides a benchmark for fetoscopy placental vessel segmentation and registration by contributing the first in vivo vessel segmentation and fetoscopic videos dataset.      
### 48.The UU-Net: Reversible Face De-Identification for Visual Surveillance Video Footage  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04316.pdf)
>  We propose a reversible face de-identification method for low resolution video data, where landmark-based techniques cannot be reliably used. Our solution is able to generate a photo realistic de-identified stream that meets the data protection regulations and can be publicly released under minimal privacy constraints. Notably, such stream encapsulates all the information required to later reconstruct the original scene, which is useful for scenarios, such as crime investigation, where the identification of the subjects is of most importance. We describe a learning process that jointly optimizes two main components: 1) a public module, that receives the raw data and generates the de-identified stream, where the ID information is surrogated in a photo-realistic and seamless way; and 2) a private module, designed for legal/security authorities, that analyses the public stream and reconstructs the original scene, disclosing the actual IDs of all the subjects in the scene. The proposed solution is landmarks-free and uses a conditional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic faces that preserve pose, lighting, background information and even facial expressions. Also, we enable full control over the set of soft facial attributes that should be preserved between the raw and de-identified data, which broads the range of applications for this solution. Our experiments were conducted in three different visual surveillance datasets (BIODI, MARS and P-DESTRE) and showed highly encouraging results.

### 49.One Policy to Control Them All: Shared Modular Policies for Agent-Agnostic Control  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04976.pdf)
>  Reinforcement learning is typically concerned with learning control policies tailored to a particular agent. We investigate whether there exists a single global policy that can generalize to control a wide variety of agent morphologies -- ones in which even dimensionality of state and action spaces changes. We propose to express this global policy as a collection of identical modular neural networks, dubbed as Shared Modular Policies (SMP), that correspond to each of the agent's actuators. Every module is only responsible for controlling its corresponding actuator and receives information from only its local sensors. In addition, messages are passed between modules, propagating information between distant modules. We show that a single modular policy can successfully generate locomotion behaviors for several planar agents with different skeletal structures such as monopod hoppers, quadrupeds, bipeds, and generalize to variants not seen during training -- a process that would normally require training and manual hyperparameter tuning for each morphology. We observe that a wide variety of drastically diverse locomotion styles across morphologies as well as centralized coordination emerges via message passing between decentralized modules purely from the reinforcement learning objective.

### 50.Invertible Zero-Shot Recognition Flows  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04873.pdf)
>  Deep generative models have been successfully applied to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) recently. However, the underlying drawbacks of GANs and VAEs (e.g., the hardness of training with ZSL-oriented regularizers and the limited generation quality) hinder the existing generative ZSL models from fully bypassing the seen-unseen bias. To tackle the above limitations, for the first time, this work incorporates a new family of generative models (i.e., flow-based models) into ZSL. The proposed Invertible Zero-shot Flow (IZF) learns factorized data embeddings (i.e., the semantic factors and the non-semantic ones) with the forward pass of an invertible flow network, while the reverse pass generates data samples. This procedure theoretically extends conventional generative flows to a factorized conditional scheme. To explicitly solve the bias problem, our model enlarges the seen-unseen distributional discrepancy based on negative sample-based distance measurement. Notably, IZF works flexibly with either a naive Bayesian classifier or a held-out trainable one for zero-shot recognition. Experiments on widely-adopted ZSL benchmarks demonstrate the significant performance gain of IZF over existing methods, in both classic and generalized settings.      
### 51.Medical Instrument Detection in Ultrasound-Guided Interventions: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04807.pdf)
>  Medical instrument detection is essential for computer-assisted interventions since it would facilitate the surgeons to find the instrument efficiently with a better interpretation, which leads to a better outcome. This article reviews medical instrument detection methods in the ultrasound-guided intervention. First, we present a comprehensive review of instrument detection methodologies, which include traditional non-data-driven methods and data-driven methods. The non-data-driven methods were extensively studied prior to the era of machine learning, i.e. data-driven approaches. We discuss the main clinical applications of medical instrument detection in ultrasound, including anesthesia, biopsy, prostate brachytherapy, and cardiac catheterization, which were validated on clinical datasets. Finally, we selected several principal publications to summarize the key issues and potential research directions for the computer-assisted intervention community.      
### 52.Client Adaptation improves Federated Learning with Simulated Non-IID Clients  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04806.pdf)
>  We present a federated learning approach for learning a client adaptable, robust model when data is non-identically and non-independently distributed (non-IID) across clients. By simulating heterogeneous clients, we show that adding learned client-specific conditioning improves model performance, and the approach is shown to work on balanced and imbalanced data set from both audio and image domains. The client adaptation is implemented by a conditional gated activation unit and is particularly beneficial when there are large differences between the data distribution for each client, a common scenario in federated learning.      
### 53.A Systematic Review on Context-Aware Recommender Systems using Deep Learning and Embeddings  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04782.pdf)
>  Recommender Systems are tools that improve how users find relevant information in web systems, so they do not face too much information. In order to generate better recommendations, the context of information should be used in the recommendation process. Context-Aware Recommender Systems were created, accomplishing state-of-the-art results and improving traditional recommender systems. There are many approaches to build recommender systems, and two of the most prominent advances in area have been the use of Embeddings to represent the data in the recommender system, and the use of Deep Learning architectures to generate the recommendations to the user. A systematic review adopts a formal and systematic method to perform a bibliographic review, and it is used to identify and evaluate all the research in certain area of study, by analyzing the relevant research published. A systematic review was conducted to understand how the Deep Learning and Embeddings techniques are being applied to improve Context-Aware Recommender Systems. We summarized the architectures that are used to create those and the domains that they are used.      
### 54.Modelling the Distribution of 3D Brain MRI using a 2D Slice VAE  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04780.pdf)
>  Probabilistic modelling has been an essential tool in medical image analysis, especially for analyzing brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Recent deep learning techniques for estimating high-dimensional distributions, in particular Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), opened up new avenues for probabilistic modeling. Modelling of volumetric data has remained a challenge, however, because constraints on available computation and training data make it difficult effectively leverage VAEs, which are well-developed for 2D images. We propose a method to model 3D MR brain volumes distribution by combining a 2D slice VAE with a Gaussian model that captures the relationships between slices. We do so by estimating the sample mean and covariance in the latent space of the 2D model over the slice direction. This combined model lets us sample new coherent stacks of latent variables to decode into slices of a volume. We also introduce a novel evaluation method for generated volumes that quantifies how well their segmentations match those of true brain anatomy. We demonstrate that our proposed model is competitive in generating high quality volumes at high resolutions according to both traditional metrics and our proposed evaluation.      
### 55.Automated Chest CT Image Segmentation of COVID-19 Lung Infection based on 3D U-Net  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04774.pdf)
>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects billions of lives around the world and has a significant impact on public healthcare. Due to rising skepticism towards the sensitivity of RT-PCR as screening method, medical imaging like computed tomography offers great potential as alternative. For this reason, automated image segmentation is highly desired as clinical decision support for quantitative assessment and disease monitoring. However, publicly available COVID-19 imaging data is limited which leads to overfitting of traditional approaches. To address this problem, we propose an innovative automated segmentation pipeline for COVID-19 infected regions, which is able to handle small datasets by utilization as variant databases. Our method focuses on on-the-fly generation of unique and random image patches for training by performing several preprocessing methods and exploiting extensive data augmentation. For further reduction of the overfitting risk, we implemented a standard 3D U-Net architecture instead of new or computational complex neural network architectures. Through a 5-fold cross-validation on 20 CT scans of COVID-19 patients, we were able to develop a highly accurate as well as robust segmentation model for lungs and COVID-19 infected regions without overfitting on the limited data. Our method achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.956 for lungs and 0.761 for infection. We demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms related approaches, advances the state-of-the-art for COVID-19 segmentation and improves medical image analysis with limited data.

### 56.Low Dose CT Denoising via Joint Bilateral Filtering and Intelligent Parameter Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04768.pdf)
>  Denoising of clinical CT images is an active area for deep learning research. Current clinically approved methods use iterative reconstruction methods to reduce the noise in CT images. Iterative reconstruction techniques require multiple forward and backward projections, which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Recently, deep learning methods have been successfully used to denoise CT images. However, conventional deep learning methods suffer from the 'black box' problem. They have low accountability, which is necessary for use in clinical imaging situations. In this paper, we use a Joint Bilateral Filter (JBF) to denoise our CT images. The guidance image of the JBF is estimated using a deep residual convolutional neural network (CNN). The range smoothing and spatial smoothing parameters of the JBF are tuned by a deep reinforcement learning task. Our actor first chooses a parameter, and subsequently chooses an action to tune the value of the parameter. A reward network is designed to direct the reinforcement learning task. Our denoising method demonstrates good denoising performance, while retaining structural information. Our method significantly outperforms state of the art deep neural networks. Moreover, our method has only two parameters, which makes it significantly more interpretable and reduces the 'black box' problem. We experimentally measure the impact of our intelligent parameter optimization and our reward network. Our studies show that our current setup yields the best results in terms of structural preservation.      
### 57.JBFnet -- Low Dose CT Denoising by Trainable Joint Bilateral Filtering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04754.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have shown great success in low dose CT denoising. However, most of these deep neural networks have several hundred thousand trainable parameters. This, combined with the inherent non-linearity of the neural network, makes the deep neural network diffcult to understand with low accountability. In this study we introduce JBFnet, a neural network for low dose CT denoising. The architecture of JBFnet implements iterative bilateral filtering. The filter functions of the Joint Bilateral Filter (JBF) are learned via shallow convolutional networks. The guidance image is estimated by a deep neural network. JBFnet is split into four filtering blocks, each of which performs Joint Bilateral Filtering. Each JBF block consists of 112 trainable parameters, making the noise removal process comprehendable. The Noise Map (NM) is added after filtering to preserve high level features. We train JBFnet with the data from the body scans of 10 patients, and test it on the AAPM low dose CT Grand Challenge dataset. We compare JBFnet with state-of-the-art deep learning networks. JBFnet outperforms CPCE3D, GAN and deep GFnet on the test dataset in terms of noise removal while preserving structures. We conduct several ablation studies to test the performance of our network architecture and training method. Our current setup achieves the best performance, while still maintaining behavioural accountability.      
### 58.Brain Tumor Anomaly Detection via Latent Regularized Adversarial Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04734.pdf)
>  With the development of medical imaging technology, medical images have become an important basis for doctors to diagnose patients. The brain structure in the collected data is complicated, thence, doctors are required to spend plentiful energy when diagnosing brain abnormalities. Aiming at the imbalance of brain tumor data and the rare amount of labeled data, we propose an innovative brain tumor abnormality detection algorithm. The semi-supervised anomaly detection model is proposed in which only healthy (normal) brain images are trained. Model capture the common pattern of the normal images in the training process and detect anomalies based on the reconstruction error of latent space. Furthermore, the method first uses singular value to constrain the latent space and jointly optimizes the image space through multiple loss functions, which make normal samples and abnormal samples more separable in the feature-level. This paper utilizes BraTS, HCP, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and practicability. Extensive experiments on intra- and cross-dataset tests prove that our semi-supervised method achieves outperforms or comparable results to state-of-the-art supervised techniques.      
### 59.Multi-Granularity Modularized Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04670.pdf)
>  Abstract visual reasoning connects mental abilities to the physical world, which is a crucial factor in cognitive development. Most toddlers display sensitivity to this skill, but it is not easy for machines. Aimed at it, we focus on the Raven Progressive Matrices Test, designed to measure cognitive reasoning. Recent work designed some black-boxes to solve it in an end-to-end fashion, but they are incredibly complicated and difficult to explain. Inspired by cognitive studies, we propose a Multi-Granularity Modularized Network (MMoN) to bridge the gap between the processing of raw sensory information and symbolic reasoning. Specifically, it learns modularized reasoning functions to model the semantic rule from the visual grounding in a neuro-symbolic and semi-supervision way. To comprehensively evaluate MMoN, our experiments are conducted on the dataset of both seen and unseen reasoning rules. The result shows that MMoN is well suited for abstract visual reasoning and also explainable on the generalization test.      
### 60.Learning to Switch CNNs with Model Agnostic Meta Learning for Fine Precision Visual Servoing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04645.pdf)
>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied for relative camera pose estimation from labeled image-pair data, without requiring any hand-engineered features, camera intrinsic parameters or depth information. The trained CNN can be utilized for performing pose based visual servo control (PBVS). One of the ways to improve the quality of visual servo output is to improve the accuracy of the CNN for estimating the relative pose estimation. With a given state-of-the-art CNN for relative pose regression, how can we achieve an improved performance for visual servo control? In this paper, we explore switching of CNNs to improve the precision of visual servo control. The idea of switching a CNN is due to the fact that the dataset for training a relative camera pose regressor for visual servo control must contain variations in relative pose ranging from a very small scale to eventually a larger scale. We found that, training two different instances of the CNN, one for large-scale-displacements (LSD) and another for small-scale-displacements (SSD) and switching them during the visual servo execution yields better results than training a single CNN with the combined LSD+SSD data. However, it causes extra storage overhead and switching decision is taken by a manually set threshold which may not be optimal for all the scenes. To eliminate these drawbacks, we propose an efficient switching strategy based on model agnostic meta learning (MAML) algorithm. In this, a single model is trained to learn parameters which are simultaneously good for multiple tasks, namely a binary classification for switching decision, a 6DOF pose regression for LSD data and also a 6DOF pose regression for SSD data. The proposed approach performs far better than the naive approach, while storage and run-time overheads are almost negligible.      
### 61.InfoMax-GAN: Improved Adversarial Image Generation via Information Maximization and Contrastive Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04589.pdf)
>  While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are fundamental to many generative modelling applications, they suffer from numerous issues. In this work, we propose a principled framework to simultaneously address two fundamental issues in GANs: catastrophic forgetting of the discriminator and mode collapse of the generator. We achieve this by employing for GANs a contrastive learning and mutual information maximization approach, and perform extensive analyses to understand sources of improvements. Our approach significantly stabilises GAN training and improves GAN performance for image synthesis across five datasets under the same training and evaluation conditions against state-of-the-art works. Our approach is simple to implement and practical: it involves only one objective, is computationally inexpensive, and is robust across a wide range of hyperparameters without any tuning.

### 62.Neural Video Coding using Multiscale Motion Compensation and Spatiotemporal Context Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04574.pdf)
>  Over the past two decades, traditional block-based video coding has made remarkable progress and spawned a series of well-known standards such as MPEG-4, H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown their powerful capacity for visual content understanding, feature extraction and compact representation. Some previous works have explored the learnt video coding algorithms in an end-to-end manner, which show the great potential compared with traditional methods. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep neural video coding framework (NVC), which uses variational autoencoders (VAEs) with joint spatial and temporal prior aggregation (PA) to exploit the correlations in intra-frame pixels, inter-frame motions and inter-frame compensation residuals, respectively. Novel features of NVC include: 1) To estimate and compensate motion over a large range of magnitudes, we propose an unsupervised multiscale motion compensation network (MS-MCN) together with a pyramid decoder in the VAE for coding motion features that generates multiscale flow fields, 2) we design a novel adaptive spatiotemporal context model for efficient entropy coding for motion information, 3) we adopt nonlocal attention modules (NLAM) at the bottlenecks of the VAEs for implicit adaptive feature extraction and activation, leveraging its high transformation capacity and unequal weighting with joint global and local information, and 4) we introduce multi-module optimization and a multi-frame training strategy to minimize the temporal error propagation among P-frames. NVC is evaluated for the low-delay causal settings and compared with H.265/HEVC, H.264/AVC and the other learnt video compression methods following the common test conditions, demonstrating consistent gains across all popular test sequences for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.      
### 63.Efficient detection of adversarial images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04564.pdf)
>  In this paper, detection of deception attack on deep neural network (DNN) based image classification in autonomous and cyber-physical systems is considered. Several studies have shown the vulnerability of DNN to malicious deception attacks. In such attacks, some or all pixel values of an image are modified by an external attacker, so that the change is almost invisible to the human eye but significant enough for a DNN-based classifier to misclassify it. This paper first proposes a novel pre-processing technique that facilitates the detection of such modified images under any DNN-based image classifier as well as the attacker model. The proposed pre-processing algorithm involves a certain combination of principal component analysis (PCA)-based decomposition of the image, and random perturbation based detection to reduce computational complexity. Next, an adaptive version of this algorithm is proposed where a random number of perturbations are chosen adaptively using a doubly-threshold policy, and the threshold values are learnt via stochastic approximation in order to minimize the expected number of perturbations subject to constraints on the false alarm and missed detection probabilities. Numerical experiments show that the proposed detection scheme outperforms a competing algorithm while achieving reasonably low computational complexity.      
### 64.Wandering Within a World: Online Contextualized Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04546.pdf)
>  We aim to bridge the gap between typical human and machine-learning environments by extending the standard framework of few-shot learning to an online, continual setting. In this setting, episodes do not have separate training and testing phases, and instead models are evaluated online while learning novel classes. As in real world, where the presence of spatiotemporal context helps us retrieve learned skills in the past, our online few-shot learning setting also features an underlying context that changes throughout time. Object classes are correlated within a context and inferring the correct context can lead to better performance. Building upon this setting, we propose a new few-shot learning dataset based on large scale indoor imagery that mimics the visual experience of an agent wandering within a world. Furthermore, we convert popular few-shot learning approaches into online versions and we also propose a new model named contextual prototypical memory that can make use of spatiotemporal contextual information from the recent past.      
### 65.Automatic Probe Movement Guidance for Freehand Obstetric Ultrasound  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04480.pdf)
>  We present the first system that provides real-time probe movement guidance for acquiring standard planes in routine freehand obstetric ultrasound scanning. Such a system can contribute to the worldwide deployment of obstetric ultrasound scanning by lowering the required level of operator expertise. The system employs an artificial neural network that receives the ultrasound video signal and the motion signal of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that is attached to the probe, and predicts a guidance signal. The network termed US-GuideNet predicts either the movement towards the standard plane position (goal prediction), or the next movement that an expert sonographer would perform (action prediction). While existing models for other ultrasound applications are trained with simulations or phantoms, we train our model with real-world ultrasound video and probe motion data from 464 routine clinical scans by 17 accredited sonographers. Evaluations for 3 standard plane types show that the model provides a useful guidance signal with an accuracy of 88.8% for goal prediction and 90.9% for action prediction.      
### 66.Journey Towards Tiny Perceptual Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04356.pdf)
>  Recent works in single-image perceptual super-resolution (SR) have demonstrated unprecedented performance in generating realistic textures by means of deep convolutional networks. However, these convolutional models are excessively large and expensive, hindering their effective deployment to end devices. In this work, we propose a neural architecture search (NAS) approach that integrates NAS and generative adversarial networks (GANs) with recent advances in perceptual SR and pushes the efficiency of small perceptual SR models to facilitate on-device execution. Specifically, we search over the architectures of both the generator and the discriminator sequentially, highlighting the unique challenges and key observations of searching for an SR-optimized discriminator and comparing them with existing discriminator architectures in the literature. Our tiny perceptual SR (TPSR) models outperform SRGAN and EnhanceNet on both full-reference perceptual metric (LPIPS) and distortion metric (PSNR) while being up to 26.4$\times$ more memory efficient and 33.6$\times$ more compute efficient respectively.      
### 67.Lightweight Image Super-Resolution with Enhanced CNN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04344.pdf)
>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with strong expressive ability have achieved impressive performances on single image super-resolution (SISR). However, their excessive amounts of convolutions and parameters usually consume high computational cost and more memory storage for training a SR model, which limits their applications to SR with resource-constrained devices in real world. To resolve these problems, we propose a lightweight enhanced SR CNN (LESRCN-N) with three successive sub-blocks, an information extraction and enhancement block (IEEB), a reconstruction block (RB) and an information refinement block (IRB). Specifically, the IEEB extracts hierarchical low-resolution (LR) features and aggregates the obtained features step-by-step to increase the memory ability of the shallow layers on deep layers for SISR. To remove redundant information obtained, a heterogeneous architecture is adopted in the IEEB. After that, the RB converts low-frequency features into high-frequency features by fusing global and local features, which is complementary with the IEEB in tackling the long-term dependency problem. Finally, the IRB uses coarse high-frequency features from the RB to learn more accurate SR features and construct a SR image. The proposed LESRCNN can obtain a high-quality image by a model for different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LESRCNN outperforms state-of-the-arts on SISR in terms of qualitative and quantitative evaluation.
