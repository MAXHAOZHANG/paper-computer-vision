### 1.Multi-person 3D Pose Estimation in Crowded Scenes Based on Multi-View Geometry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10986.pdf)
>  Epipolar constraints are at the core of feature matching and depth estimation in current multi-person multi-camera 3D human pose estimation methods. Despite the satisfactory performance of this formulation in sparser crowd scenes, its effectiveness is frequently challenged under denser crowd circumstances mainly due to two sources of ambiguity. The first is the mismatch of human joints resulting from the simple cues provided by the Euclidean distances between joints and epipolar lines. The second is the lack of robustness from the naive formulation of the problem as a least squares minimization. In this paper, we depart from the multi-person 3D pose estimation formulation, and instead reformulate it as crowd pose estimation. Our method consists of two key components: a graph model for fast cross-view matching, and a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator for the reconstruction of the 3D human poses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method on four benchmark datasets.      
### 2.PointContrast: Unsupervised Pre-training for 3D Point Cloud Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10985.pdf)
>  Arguably one of the top success stories of deep learning is transfer learning. The finding that pre-training a network on a rich source set (eg., ImageNet) can help boost performance once fine-tuned on a usually much smaller target set, has been instrumental to many applications in language and vision. Yet, very little is known about its usefulness in 3D point cloud understanding. We see this as an opportunity considering the effort required for annotating data in 3D. In this work, we aim at facilitating research on 3D representation learning. Different from previous works, we focus on high-level scene understanding tasks. To this end, we select a suite of diverse datasets and tasks to measure the effect of unsupervised pre-training on a large source set of 3D scenes. Our findings are extremely encouraging: using a unified triplet of architecture, source dataset, and contrastive loss for pre-training, we achieve improvement over recent best results in segmentation and detection across 6 different benchmarks for indoor and outdoor, real and synthetic datasets -- demonstrating that the learned representation can generalize across domains. Furthermore, the improvement was similar to supervised pre-training, suggesting that future efforts should favor scaling data collection over more detailed annotation. We hope these findings will encourage more research on unsupervised pretext task design for 3D deep learning.      
### 3.Foley Music: Learning to Generate Music from Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10984.pdf)
>  In this paper, we introduce Foley Music, a system that can synthesize plausible music for a silent video clip about people playing musical instruments. We first identify two key intermediate representations for a successful video to music generator: body keypoints from videos and MIDI events from audio recordings. We then formulate music generation from videos as a motion-to-MIDI translation problem. We present a Graph$-$Transformer framework that can accurately predict MIDI event sequences in accordance with the body movements. The MIDI event can then be converted to realistic music using an off-the-shelf music synthesizer tool. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our models on videos containing a variety of music performances. Experimental results show that our model outperforms several existing systems in generating music that is pleasant to listen to. More importantly, the MIDI representations are fully interpretable and transparent, thus enabling us to perform music editing flexibly. We encourage the readers to watch the demo video with audio turned on to experience the results.      
### 4.Learning Monocular Visual Odometry via Self-Supervised Long-Term Modeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10983.pdf)
>  Monocular visual odometry (VO) suffers severely from error accumulation during frame-to-frame pose estimation. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning method for VO with special consideration for consistency over longer sequences. To this end, we model the long-term dependency in pose prediction using a pose network that features a two-layer convolutional LSTM module. We train the networks with purely self-supervised losses, including a cycle consistency loss that mimics the loop closure module in geometric VO. Inspired by prior geometric systems, we allow the networks to see beyond a small temporal window during training, through a novel a loss that incorporates temporally distant (e.g., O(100)) frames. Given GPU memory constraints, we propose a stage-wise training mechanism, where the first stage operates in a local time window and the second stage refines the poses with a "global" loss given the first stage features. We demonstrate competitive results on several standard VO datasets, including KITTI and TUM RGB-D.      
### 5.Shape and Viewpoint without Keypoints  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10982.pdf)
>  We present a learning framework that learns to recover the 3D shape, pose and texture from a single image, trained on an image collection without any ground truth 3D shape, multi-view, camera viewpoints or keypoint supervision. We approach this highly under-constrained problem in a "analysis by synthesis" framework where the goal is to predict the likely shape, texture and camera viewpoint that could produce the image with various learned category-specific priors. Our particular contribution in this paper is a representation of the distribution over cameras, which we call "camera-multiplex". Instead of picking a point estimate, we maintain a set of camera hypotheses that are optimized during training to best explain the image given the current shape and texture. We call our approach Unsupervised Category-Specific Mesh Reconstruction (U-CMR), and present qualitative and quantitative results on CUB, Pascal 3D and new web-scraped datasets. We obtain state-of-the-art camera prediction results and show that we can learn to predict diverse shapes and textures across objects using an image collection without any keypoint annotations or 3D ground truth.

### 6.Neural Mesh Flow: 3D Manifold Mesh Generationvia Diffeomorphic Flows  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10973.pdf)
>  Meshes are important representations of physical 3D entities in the virtual world. Applications like rendering, simulations and 3D printing require meshes to be manifold so that they can interact with the world like the real objects they represent. Prior methods generate meshes with great geometric accuracy but poor manifoldness. In this work, we propose Neural Mesh Flow (NMF) to generate two-manifold meshes for genus-0 shapes. Specifically, NMF is a shape auto-encoder consisting of several Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE)[1]blocks that learn accurate mesh geometry by progressively deforming a spherical mesh. Training NMF is simpler compared to state-of-the-art methods since it does not require any explicit mesh-based regularization. Our experiments demonstrate that NMF facilitates several applications such as single-view mesh reconstruction, global shape parameterization, texture mapping, shape deformation and correspondence. Importantly, we demonstrate that manifold meshes generated using NMF are better-suited for physically-based rendering and simulation. Code and data will be released.      
### 7.Recurrent Exposure Generation for Low-Light Face Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10963.pdf)
>  Face detection from low-light images is challenging due to limited photos and inevitable noise, which, to make the task even harder, are often spatially unevenly distributed. A natural solution is to borrow the idea from multi-exposure, which captures multiple shots to obtain well-exposed images under challenging conditions. High-quality implementation/approximation of multi-exposure from a single image is however nontrivial. Fortunately, as shown in this paper, neither is such high-quality necessary since our task is face detection rather than image enhancement. Specifically, we propose a novel Recurrent Exposure Generation (REG) module and couple it seamlessly with a Multi-Exposure Detection (MED) module, and thus significantly improve face detection performance by effectively inhibiting non-uniform illumination and noise issues. REG produces progressively and efficiently intermediate images corresponding to various exposure settings, and such pseudo-exposures are then fused by MED to detect faces across different lighting conditions. The proposed method, named REGDet, is the first `detection-with-enhancement' framework for low-light face detection. It not only encourages rich interaction and feature fusion across different illumination levels, but also enables effective end-to-end learning of the REG component to be better tailored for face detection. Moreover, as clearly shown in our experiments, REG can be flexibly coupled with different face detectors without extra low/normal-light image pairs for training. We tested REGDet on the DARK FACE low-light face benchmark with thorough ablation study, where REGDet outperforms previous state-of-the-arts by a significant margin, with only negligible extra parameters.      
### 8.Procrustean Regression Networks: Learning 3D Structure of Non-Rigid Objects from 2D Annotations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10961.pdf)
>  We propose a novel framework for training neural networks which is capable of learning 3D information of non-rigid objects when only 2D annotations are available as ground truths. Recently, there have been some approaches that incorporate the problem setting of non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM) into deep learning to learn 3D structure reconstruction. The most important difficulty of NRSfM is to estimate both the rotation and deformation at the same time, and previous works handle this by regressing both of them. In this paper, we resolve this difficulty by proposing a loss function wherein the suitable rotation is automatically determined. Trained with the cost function consisting of the reprojection error and the low-rank term of aligned shapes, the network learns the 3D structures of such objects as human skeletons and faces during the training, whereas the testing is done in a single-frame basis. The proposed method can handle inputs with missing entries and experimental results validate that the proposed framework shows superior reconstruction performance to the state-of-the-art method on the Human 3.6M, 300-VW, and SURREAL datasets, even though the underlying network structure is very simple.      
### 9.Garment Design with Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10947.pdf)
>  The designers' tendency to adhere to a specific mental set and heavy emotional investment in their initial ideas often hinder their ability to innovate during the design thinking and ideation process. In the fashion industry, in particular, the growing diversity of customers' needs, the intense global competition, and the shrinking time-to-market (a.k.a., "fast fashion") further exacerbate this challenge for designers. Recent advances in deep generative models have created new possibilities to overcome the cognitive obstacles of designers through automated generation and/or editing of design concepts. This paper explores the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for automated attribute-level editing of design concepts. Specifically, attribute GAN (AttGAN)---a generative model proven successful for attribute editing of human faces---is utilized for automated editing of the visual attributes of garments and tested on a large fashion dataset. The experiments support the hypothesized potentials of GAN for attribute-level editing of design concepts, and underscore several key limitations and research questions to be addressed in future work.      
### 10.MovieNet: A Holistic Dataset for Movie Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10937.pdf)
>  Recent years have seen remarkable advances in visual understanding. However, how to understand a story-based long video with artistic styles, e.g. movie, remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce MovieNet -- a holistic dataset for movie understanding. MovieNet contains 1,100 movies with a large amount of multi-modal data, e.g. trailers, photos, plot descriptions, etc. Besides, different aspects of manual annotations are provided in MovieNet, including 1.1M characters with bounding boxes and identities, 42K scene boundaries, 2.5K aligned description sentences, 65K tags of place and action, and 92K tags of cinematic style. To the best of our knowledge, MovieNet is the largest dataset with richest annotations for comprehensive movie understanding. Based on MovieNet, we set up several benchmarks for movie understanding from different angles. Extensive experiments are executed on these benchmarks to show the immeasurable value of MovieNet and the gap of current approaches towards comprehensive movie understanding. We believe that such a holistic dataset would promote the researches on story-based long video understanding and beyond. MovieNet will be published in compliance with regulations at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://movienet.github.io" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 11.Representative-Discriminative Learning for Open-set Land Cover Classification of Satellite Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10891.pdf)
>  Land cover classification of satellite imagery is an important step toward analyzing the Earth's surface. Existing models assume a closed-set setting where both the training and testing classes belong to the same label set. However, due to the unique characteristics of satellite imagery with an extremely vast area of versatile cover materials, the training data are bound to be non-representative. In this paper, we study the problem of open-set land cover classification that identifies the samples belonging to unknown classes during testing, while maintaining performance on known classes. Although inherently a classification problem, both representative and discriminative aspects of data need to be exploited in order to better distinguish unknown classes from known. We propose a representative-discriminative open-set recognition (RDOSR) framework, which 1) projects data from the raw image space to the embedding feature space that facilitates differentiating similar classes, and further 2) enhances both the representative and discriminative capacity through transformation to a so-called abundance space. Experiments on multiple satellite benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We also show the generality of the proposed approach by achieving promising results on open-set classification tasks using RGB images.      
### 12.Dense Hybrid Recurrent Multi-view Stereo Net with Dynamic Consistency Checking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10872.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective dense hybrid recurrent multi-view stereo net with dynamic consistency checking, namely $D^{2}$HC-RMVSNet, for accurate dense point cloud reconstruction. Our novel hybrid recurrent multi-view stereo net consists of two core modules: 1) a light DRENet (Dense Reception Expanded) module to extract dense feature maps of original size with multi-scale context information, 2) a HU-LSTM (Hybrid U-LSTM) to regularize 3D matching volume into predicted depth map, which efficiently aggregates different scale information by coupling LSTM and U-Net architecture. To further improve the accuracy and completeness of reconstructed point clouds, we leverage a dynamic consistency checking strategy instead of prefixed parameters and strategies widely adopted in existing methods for dense point cloud reconstruction. In doing so, we dynamically aggregate geometric consistency matching error among all the views. Our method ranks \textbf{$1^{st}$} on the complex outdoor \textsl{Tanks and Temples} benchmark over all the methods. Extensive experiments on the in-door DTU dataset show our method exhibits competitive performance to the state-of-the-art method while dramatically reduces memory consumption, which costs only $19.4\%$ of R-MVSNet memory consumption.

### 13.GarNet++: Improving Fast and Accurate Static3D Cloth Draping by Curvature Loss  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10867.pdf)
>  In this paper, we tackle the problem of static 3D cloth draping on virtual human bodies. We introduce a two-stream deep network model that produces a visually plausible draping of a template cloth on virtual 3D bodies by extracting features from both the body and garment shapes. Our network learns to mimic a Physics-Based Simulation (PBS) method while requiring two orders of magnitude less computation time. To train the network, we introduce loss terms inspired by PBS to produce plausible results and make the model collision-aware. To increase the details of the draped garment, we introduce two loss functions that penalize the difference between the curvature of the predicted cloth and PBS. Particularly, we study the impact of mean curvature normal and a novel detail-preserving loss both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our new curvature loss computes the local covariance matrices of the 3D points, and compares the Rayleigh quotients of the prediction and PBS. This leads to more details while performing favorably or comparably against the loss that considers mean curvature normal vectors in the 3D triangulated meshes. We validate our framework on four garment types for various body shapes and poses. Finally, we achieve superior performance against a recently proposed data-driven method.      
### 14.Multi-label Thoracic Disease Image Classification with Cross-Attention Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10859.pdf)
>  Automated disease classification of radiology images has been emerging as a promising technique to support clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Unlike generic image classification tasks, a real-world radiology image classification task is significantly more challenging as it is far more expensive to collect the training data where the labeled data is in nature multi-label; and more seriously samples from easy classes often dominate; training data is highly class-imbalanced problem exists in practice as well. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel scheme of Cross-Attention Networks (CAN) for automated thoracic disease classification from chest x-ray images, which can effectively excavate more meaningful representation from data to boost the performance through cross-attention by only image-level annotations. We also design a new loss function that beyond cross-entropy loss to help cross-attention process and is able to overcome the imbalance between classes and easy-dominated samples within each class. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results.      
### 15.Joint Visual and Temporal Consistency for Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Person Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10854.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptive person Re-IDentification (ReID) is challenging because of the large domain gap between source and target domains, as well as the lackage of labeled data on the target domain. This paper tackles this challenge through jointly enforcing visual and temporal consistency in the combination of a local one-hot classification and a global multi-class classification. The local one-hot classification assigns images in a training batch with different person IDs, then adopts a Self-Adaptive Classification (SAC) model to classify them. The global multi-class classification is achieved by predicting labels on the entire unlabeled training set with the Memory-based Temporal-guided Cluster (MTC). MTC predicts multi-class labels by considering both visual similarity and temporal consistency to ensure the quality of label prediction. The two classification models are combined in a unified framework, which effectively leverages the unlabeled data for discriminative feature learning. Experimental results on three large-scale ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of proposed method in both unsupervised and unsupervised domain adaptive ReID tasks. For example, under unsupervised setting, our method outperforms recent unsupervised domain adaptive methods, which leverage more labels for training.      
### 16.Soft Expert Reward Learning for Vision-and-Language Navigation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10835.pdf)
>  Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to find a specified spot in an unseen environment by following natural language instructions. Dominant methods based on supervised learning clone expert's behaviours and thus perform better on seen environments, while showing restricted performance on unseen ones. Reinforcement Learning (RL) based models show better generalisation ability but have issues as well, requiring large amount of manual reward engineering is one of which. In this paper, we introduce a Soft Expert Reward Learning (SERL) model to overcome the reward engineering designing and generalisation problems of the VLN task. Our proposed method consists of two complementary components: Soft Expert Distillation (SED) module encourages agents to behave like an expert as much as possible, but in a soft fashion; Self Perceiving (SP) module targets at pushing the agent towards the final destination as fast as possible. Empirically, we evaluate our model on the VLN seen, unseen and test splits and the model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on most of the evaluation metrics.      
### 17.Lymphocyte counting -- Error Analysis of Regression versus Bounding Box Detection Approaches  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10817.pdf)
>  We consider the problem of counting cell nuclei from celltype-agnostic histopathological stains, exemplified here by the Haematoxylin and Eosin stain. We compare direct estimation by classification and regression against bounding box prediction models for a dataset with relatively low sample sizes. We find from a fine-grained analysis of MSE errors that all models suffer from a substantial underestimation bias. Detection models, while more capricious and sensitive in training, are more robust against underestimation in their optimum. Furthermore the simple idea of combining models from different prediction setups results in large improvements.      
### 18.Deep Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation for Overlapping Cervical Cell Instance Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10787.pdf)
>  Deep learning methods show promising results for overlapping cervical cell instance segmentation. However, in order to train a model with good generalization ability, voluminous pixel-level annotations are demanded which is quite expensive and time-consuming for acquisition. In this paper, we propose to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data for instance segmentation with improved accuracy by knowledge distillation. We propose a novel Mask-guided Mean Teacher framework with Perturbation-sensitive Sample Mining (MMT-PSM), which consists of a teacher and a student network during training. Two networks are encouraged to be consistent both in feature and semantic level under small perturbations. The teacher's self-ensemble predictions from $K$-time augmented samples are used to construct the reliable pseudo-labels for optimizing the student. We design a novel strategy to estimate the sensitivity to perturbations for each proposal and select informative samples from massive cases to facilitate fast and effective semantic distillation. In addition, to eliminate the unavoidable noise from the background region, we propose to use the predicted segmentation mask as guidance to enforce the feature distillation in the foreground region. Experiments show that the proposed method improves the performance significantly compared with the supervised method learned from labeled data only, and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.      
### 19.Complementing Representation Deficiency in Few-shot Image Classification: A Meta-Learning Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10778.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning is a challenging problem that has attracted more and more attention recently since abundant training samples are difficult to obtain in practical applications. Meta-learning has been proposed to address this issue, which focuses on quickly adapting a predictor as a base-learner to new tasks, given limited labeled samples. However, a critical challenge for meta-learning is the representation deficiency since it is hard to discover common information from a small number of training samples or even one, as is the representation of key features from such little information. As a result, a meta-learner cannot be trained well in a high-dimensional parameter space to generalize to new tasks. Existing methods mostly resort to extracting less expressive features so as to avoid the representation deficiency. Aiming at learning better representations, we propose a meta-learning approach with complemented representations network (MCRNet) for few-shot image classification. In particular, we embed a latent space, where latent codes are reconstructed with extra representation information to complement the representation deficiency. Furthermore, the latent space is established with variational inference, collaborating well with different base-learners, and can be extended to other models. Finally, our end-to-end framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in image classification on three standard few-shot learning datasets.      
### 20.Enhancement of damaged-image prediction through Cahn-Hilliard Image Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10753.pdf)
>  We assess the benefit of including an image inpainting filter before passing damaged images into a classification neural network. For this we employ a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation as an image inpainting filter, which is solved via a finite volume scheme with reduced computational cost and adequate properties for energy stability and boundedness. The benchmark dataset employed here is the MNIST dataset, which consists in binary images of digits. We train a neural network based of dense layers with the training set of MNIST, and subsequently we contaminate the test set with damage of different types and intensities. We then compare the prediction accuracy of the neural network with and without applying the Cahn-Hilliard filter to the damaged images test. Our results quantify the significant improvement of damaged-image prediction due to applying the Cahn-Hilliard filter, which for specific damages can increase up to 50% and is in general advantageous for low to moderate damage.      
### 21.Movement Assessment from Skeleton Videos: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10737.pdf)
>  The raising availability of 3D cameras and dramatic improvement of computer vision algorithms in the recent decade, accelerated the research of automatic movement assessment solutions. Such solutions can be implemented at home, using affordable equipment and dedicated software. In this paper, we divide the movement assessment task into secondary tasks and explain why they are needed and how they can be addressed. We review the recent solutions for automatic movement assessment from skeleton videos, comparing them by their objectives, features, movement domains and algorithmic approaches.      
### 22.Shape-aware Semi-supervised 3D Semantic Segmentation for Medical Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10732.pdf)
>  Semi-supervised learning has attracted much attention in medical image segmentation due to challenges in acquiring pixel-wise image annotations, which is a crucial step for building high-performance deep learning methods. Most existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches either tend to neglect geometric constraint in object segments, leading to incomplete object coverage, or impose strong shape prior that requires extra alignment. In this work, we propose a novel shapeaware semi-supervised segmentation strategy to leverage abundant unlabeled data and to enforce a geometric shape constraint on the segmentation output. To achieve this, we develop a multi-task deep network that jointly predicts semantic segmentation and signed distance map(SDM) of object surfaces. During training, we introduce an adversarial loss between the predicted SDMs of labeled and unlabeled data so that our network is able to capture shape-aware features more effectively. Experiments on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge dataset show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches with improved shape estimation, which validates its efficacy.

### 23.Video Representation Learning by Recognizing Temporal Transformations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10730.pdf)
>  We introduce a novel self-supervised learning approach to learn representations of videos that are responsive to changes in the motion dynamics. Our representations can be learned from data without human annotation and provide a substantial boost to the training of neural networks on small labeled data sets for tasks such as action recognition, which require to accurately distinguish the motion of objects. We promote an accurate learning of motion without human annotation by training a neural network to discriminate a video sequence from its temporally transformed versions. To learn to distinguish non-trivial motions, the design of the transformations is based on two principles: 1) To define clusters of motions based on time warps of different magnitude; 2) To ensure that the discrimination is feasible only by observing and analyzing as many image frames as possible. Thus, we introduce the following transformations: forward-backward playback, random frame skipping, and uniform frame skipping. Our experiments show that networks trained with the proposed method yield representations with improved transfer performance for action recognition on UCF101 and HMDB51.      
### 24.Balance Scene Learning Mechanism for Offshore and Inshore Ship Detection in SAR Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10714.pdf)

### 25.Uncertainty-Aware Weakly Supervised Action Detection from Untrimmed Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10703.pdf)
>  Despite the recent advances in video classification, progress in spatio-temporal action recognition has lagged behind. A major contributing factor has been the prohibitive cost of annotating videos frame-by-frame. In this paper, we present a spatio-temporal action recognition model that is trained with only video-level labels, which are significantly easier to annotate. Our method leverages per-frame person detectors which have been trained on large image datasets within a Multiple Instance Learning framework. We show how we can apply our method in cases where the standard Multiple Instance Learning assumption, that each bag contains at least one instance with the specified label, is invalid using a novel probabilistic variant of MIL where we estimate the uncertainty of each prediction. Furthermore, we report the first weakly-supervised results on the AVA dataset and state-of-the-art results among weakly-supervised methods on UCF101-24.      
### 26.Deep Preset: Blending and Retouching Photos with Color Style Transfer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10701.pdf)
>  End-users, without knowledge in photography, desire to beautify their photos to have a similar color style as a well-retouched reference. However, recent works in image style transfer are overused. They usually synthesize undesirable results due to transferring exact colors to the wrong destination. It becomes even worse in sensitive cases such as portraits. In this work, we concentrate on learning low-level image transformation, especially color-shifting methods, rather than mixing contextual features, then present a novel scheme to train color style transfer with ground-truth. Furthermore, we propose a color style transfer named Deep Preset. It is designed to 1) generalize the features representing the color transformation from content with natural colors to retouched reference, then blend it into the contextual features of content, 2) predict hyper-parameters (settings or preset) of the applied low-level color transformation methods, 3) stylize content to have a similar color style as reference. We script Lightroom, a powerful tool in editing photos, to generate 600,000 training samples using 1,200 images from the Flick2K dataset and 500 user-generated presets with 69 settings. Experimental results show that our Deep Preset outperforms the previous works in color style transfer quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 27.Relative Pose Estimation for Multi-Camera Systems from Affine Correspondences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10700.pdf)
>  We propose four novel solvers for estimating the relative pose of a multi-camera system from affine correspondences (ACs). A new constraint is derived interpreting the relationship of ACs and the generalized camera model. Using the constraint, it is shown that a minimum of two ACs are enough for recovering the 6DOF relative pose, i.e., 3D rotation and translation, of the system. Considering planar camera motion, we propose a minimal solution using a single AC and a solver with two ACs to overcome the degenerate case. Also, we propose a minimal solution using two ACs with known gravity vector, e.g., from an IMU. Since the proposed methods require significantly fewer correspondences than state-of-the-art algorithms, they can be efficiently used within RANSAC for outlier removal and initial motion estimation. The solvers are tested both on synthetic data and on real-world scenes from the KITTI benchmark. It is shown that the accuracy of the estimated poses is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques.      
### 28.A Deep Ordinal Distortion Estimation Approach for Distortion Rectification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10689.pdf)
>  Distortion is widely existed in the images captured by popular wide-angle cameras and fisheye cameras. Despite the long history of distortion rectification, accurately estimating the distortion parameters from a single distorted image is still challenging. The main reason is these parameters are implicit to image features, influencing the networks to fully learn the distortion information. In this work, we propose a novel distortion rectification approach that can obtain more accurate parameters with higher efficiency. Our key insight is that distortion rectification can be cast as a problem of learning an ordinal distortion from a single distorted image. To solve this problem, we design a local-global associated estimation network that learns the ordinal distortion to approximate the realistic distortion distribution. In contrast to the implicit distortion parameters, the proposed ordinal distortion have more explicit relationship with image features, and thus significantly boosts the distortion perception of neural networks. Considering the redundancy of distortion information, our approach only uses a part of distorted image for the ordinal distortion estimation, showing promising applications in the efficient distortion rectification. To our knowledge, we first unify the heterogeneous distortion parameters into a learning-friendly intermediate representation through ordinal distortion, bridging the gap between image feature and distortion rectification. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, with approximately 23% improvement on the quantitative evaluation while displaying the best performance on visual appearance.      
### 29.Fine-Grained Image Captioning with Global-Local Discriminative Objective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10662.pdf)
>  Significant progress has been made in recent years in image captioning, an active topic in the fields of vision and language. However, existing methods tend to yield overly general captions and consist of some of the most frequent words/phrases, resulting in inaccurate and indistinguishable descriptions (see Figure 1). This is primarily due to (i) the conservative characteristic of traditional training objectives that drives the model to generate correct but hardly discriminative captions for similar images and (ii) the uneven word distribution of the ground-truth captions, which encourages generating highly frequent words/phrases while suppressing the less frequent but more concrete ones. In this work, we propose a novel global-local discriminative objective that is formulated on top of a reference model to facilitate generating fine-grained descriptive captions. Specifically, from a global perspective, we design a novel global discriminative constraint that pulls the generated sentence to better discern the corresponding image from all others in the entire dataset. From the local perspective, a local discriminative constraint is proposed to increase attention such that it emphasizes the less frequent but more concrete words/phrases, thus facilitating the generation of captions that better describe the visual details of the given images. We evaluate the proposed method on the widely used MS-COCO dataset, where it outperforms the baseline methods by a sizable margin and achieves competitive performance over existing leading approaches. We also conduct self-retrieval experiments to demonstrate the discriminability of the proposed method.      
### 30.Multi-modal Transformer for Video Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10639.pdf)
>  The task of retrieving video content relevant to natural language queries plays a critical role in effectively handling internet-scale datasets. Most of the existing methods for this caption-to-video retrieval problem do not fully exploit cross-modal cues present in video. Furthermore, they aggregate per-frame visual features with limited or no temporal information. In this paper, we present a multi-modal transformer to jointly encode the different modalities in video, which allows each of them to attend to the others. The transformer architecture is also leveraged to encode and model the temporal information. On the natural language side, we investigate the best practices to jointly optimize the language embedding together with the multi-modal transformer. This novel framework allows us to establish state-of-the-art results for video retrieval on three datasets.

### 31.Learning Person Re-identification Models from Videos with Weak Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10631.pdf)
>  Most person re-identification methods, being supervised techniques, suffer from the burden of massive annotation requirement. Unsupervised methods overcome this need for labeled data, but perform poorly compared to the supervised alternatives. In order to cope with this issue, we introduce the problem of learning person re-identification models from videos with weak supervision. The weak nature of the supervision arises from the requirement of video-level labels, i.e. person identities who appear in the video, in contrast to the more precise framelevel annotations. Towards this goal, we propose a multiple instance attention learning framework for person re-identification using such video-level labels. Specifically, we first cast the video person re-identification task into a multiple instance learning setting, in which person images in a video are collected into a bag. The relations between videos with similar labels can be utilized to identify persons, on top of that, we introduce a co-person attention mechanism which mines the similarity correlations between videos with person identities in common. The attention weights are obtained based on all person images instead of person tracklets in a video, making our learned model less affected by noisy annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the related methods on two weakly labeled person re-identification datasets.      
### 32.Novel View Synthesis on Unpaired Data by Conditional Deformable Variational Auto-Encoder  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10618.pdf)
>  Novel view synthesis often needs the paired data from both the source and target views. This paper proposes a view translation model under cVAE-GAN framework without requiring the paired data. We design a conditional deformable module (CDM) which uses the view condition vectors as the filters to convolve the feature maps of the main branch in VAE. It generates several pairs of displacement maps to deform the features, like the 2D optical flows. The results are fed into the deformed feature based normalization module (DFNM), which scales and offsets the main branch feature, given its deformed one as the input from the side branch. Taking the advantage of the CDM and DFNM, the encoder outputs a view-irrelevant posterior, while the decoder takes the code drawn from it to synthesize the reconstructed and the viewtranslated images. To further ensure the disentanglement between the views and other factors, we add adversarial training on the code. The results and ablation studies on MultiPIE and 3D chair datasets validate the effectiveness of the framework in cVAE and the designed module.      
### 33.Feature-metric Loss for Self-supervised Learning of Depth and Egomotion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10603.pdf)
>  Photometric loss is widely used for self-supervised depth and egomotion estimation. However, the loss landscapes induced by photometric differences are often problematic for optimization, caused by plateau landscapes for pixels in textureless regions or multiple local minima for less discriminative pixels. In this work, feature-metric loss is proposed and defined on feature representation, where the feature representation is also learned in a self-supervised manner and regularized by both first-order and second-order derivatives to constrain the loss landscapes to form proper convergence basins. Comprehensive experiments and detailed analysis via visualization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature-metric loss. In particular, our method improves state-of-the-art methods on KITTI from 0.885 to 0.925 measured by $\delta_1$ for depth estimation, and significantly outperforms previous method for visual odometry.      
### 34.Graph-PCNN: Two Stage Human Pose Estimation with Graph Pose Refinement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10599.pdf)
>  Recently, most of the state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods are based on heatmap regression. The final coordinates of keypoints are obtained by decoding heatmap directly. In this paper, we aim to find a better approach to get more accurate localization results. We mainly put forward two suggestions for improvement: 1) different features and methods should be applied for rough and accurate localization, 2) relationship between keypoints should be considered. Specifically, we propose a two-stage graph-based and model-agnostic framework, called Graph-PCNN, with a localization subnet and a graph pose refinement module added onto the original heatmap regression network. In the first stage, heatmap regression network is applied to obtain a rough localization result, and a set of proposal keypoints, called guided points, are sampled. In the second stage, for each guided point, different visual feature is extracted by the localization subnet. The relationship between guided points is explored by the graph pose refinement module to get more accurate localization results. Experiments show that Graph-PCNN can be used in various backbones to boost the performance by a large margin. Without bells and whistles, our best model can achieve a new state-of-the-art 76.8% AP on COCO test-dev split.      
### 35.Video Super-resolution with Temporal Group Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10595.pdf)
>  Video super-resolution, which aims at producing a high-resolution video from its corresponding low-resolution version, has recently drawn increasing attention. In this work, we propose a novel method that can effectively incorporate temporal information in a hierarchical way. The input sequence is divided into several groups, with each one corresponding to a kind of frame rate. These groups provide complementary information to recover missing details in the reference frame, which is further integrated with an attention module and a deep intra-group fusion module. In addition, a fast spatial alignment is proposed to handle videos with large motion. Extensive results demonstrate the capability of the proposed model in handling videos with various motion. It achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.      
### 36.AinnoSeg: Panoramic Segmentation with High Perfomance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10591.pdf)
>  Panoramic segmentation is a scene where image segmentation tasks is more difficult. With the development of CNN networks, panoramic segmentation tasks have been sufficiently developed.However, the current panoramic segmentation algorithms are more concerned with context semantics, but the details of image are not processed enough. Moreover, they cannot solve the problems which contains the accuracy of occluded object segmentation,little object segmentation,boundary pixel in object segmentation etc. Aiming to address these issues, this paper presents some useful tricks. (a) By changing the basic segmentation model, the model can take into account the large objects and the boundary pixel classification of image details. (b) Modify the loss function so that it can take into account the boundary pixels of multiple objects in the image. (c) Use a semi-supervised approach to regain control of the training process. (d) Using multi-scale training and reasoning. All these operations named AinnoSeg, AinnoSeg can achieve state-of-art performance on the well-known dataset ADE20K.      
### 37.CyCNN: A Rotation Invariant CNN using Polar Mapping and Cylindrical Convolution Layers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10588.pdf)
>  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are empirically known to be invariant to moderate translation but not to rotation in image classification. This paper proposes a deep CNN model, called CyCNN, which exploits polar mapping of input images to convert rotation to translation. To deal with the cylindrical property of the polar coordinates, we replace convolution layers in conventional CNNs to cylindrical convolutional (CyConv) layers. A CyConv layer exploits the cylindrically sliding windows (CSW) mechanism that vertically extends the input-image receptive fields of boundary units in a convolutional layer. We evaluate CyCNN and conventional CNN models for classification tasks on rotated MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. We show that if there is no data augmentation during training, CyCNN significantly improves classification accuracies when compared to conventional CNN models. Our implementation of CyCNN is publicly available on <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/mcrl/CyCNN" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 38.Learning to Compose Hypercolumns for Visual Correspondence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10587.pdf)
>  Feature representation plays a crucial role in visual correspondence, and recent methods for image matching resort to deeply stacked convolutional layers. These models, however, are both monolithic and static in the sense that they typically use a specific level of features, e.g., the output of the last layer, and adhere to it regardless of the images to match. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to visual correspondence that dynamically composes effective features by leveraging relevant layers conditioned on the images to match. Inspired by both multi-layer feature composition in object detection and adaptive inference architectures in classification, the proposed method, dubbed Dynamic Hyperpixel Flow, learns to compose hypercolumn features on the fly by selecting a small number of relevant layers from a deep convolutional neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness on the task of semantic correspondence, i.e., establishing correspondences between images depicting different instances of the same object or scene category. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that the proposed method greatly improves matching performance over the state of the art in an adaptive and efficient manner.      
### 39.Domain Generalization with Optimal Transport and Metric Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10573.pdf)
>  Generalizing knowledge to unseen domains, where data and labels are unavailable, is crucial for machine learning models. We tackle the domain generalization problem to learn from multiple source domains and generalize to a target domain with unknown statistics. The crucial idea is to extract the underlying invariant features across all the domains. Previous domain generalization approaches mainly focused on learning invariant features and stacking the learned features from each source domain to generalize to a new target domain while ignoring the label information, which will lead to indistinguishable features with an ambiguous classification boundary. For this, one possible solution is to constrain the label-similarity when extracting the invariant features and to take advantage of the label similarities for class-specific cohesion and separation of features across domains. Therefore we adopt optimal transport with Wasserstein distance, which could constrain the class label similarity, for adversarial training and also further deploy a metric learning objective to leverage the label information for achieving distinguishable classification boundary. Empirical results show that our proposed method could outperform most of the baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies also demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of our method.      
### 40.3D Correspondence Grouping with Compatibility Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10570.pdf)
>  We present a simple yet effective method for 3D correspondence grouping. The objective is to accurately classify initial correspondences obtained by matching local geometric descriptors into inliers and outliers. Although the spatial distribution of correspondences is irregular, inliers are expected to be geometrically compatible with each other. Based on such observation, we propose a novel representation for 3D correspondences, dubbed compatibility feature (CF), to describe the consistencies within inliers and inconsistencies within outliers. CF consists of top-ranked compatibility scores of a candidate to other correspondences, which purely relies on robust and rotation-invariant geometric constraints. We then formulate the grouping problem as a classification problem for CF features, which is accomplished via a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. Comparisons with nine state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks demonstrate that: 1) CF is distinctive, robust, and rotation-invariant; 2) our CF-based method achieves the best overall performance and holds good generalization ability.      
### 41.Unified Multisensory Perception: Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10558.pdf)
>  In this paper, we introduce a new problem, named audio-visual video parsing, which aims to parse a video into temporal event segments and label them as either audible, visible, or both. Such a problem is essential for a complete understanding of the scene depicted inside a video. To facilitate exploration, we collect a Look, Listen, and Parse (LLP) dataset to investigate audio-visual video parsing in a weakly-supervised manner. This task can be naturally formulated as a Multimodal Multiple Instance Learning (MMIL) problem. Concretely, we propose a novel hybrid attention network to explore unimodal and cross-modal temporal contexts simultaneously. We develop an attentive MMIL pooling method to adaptively explore useful audio and visual content from different temporal extent and modalities. Furthermore, we discover and mitigate modality bias and noisy label issues with an individual-guided learning mechanism and label smoothing technique, respectively. Experimental results show that the challenging audio-visual video parsing can be achieved even with only video-level weak labels. Our proposed framework can effectively leverage unimodal and cross-modal temporal contexts and alleviate modality bias and noisy labels problems.      
### 42.Regularizing Deep Networks with Semantic Data Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10538.pdf)
>  Data augmentation is widely known as a simple yet surprisingly effective technique for regularizing deep networks. Conventional data augmentation schemes, e.g., flipping, translation or rotation, are low-level, data-independent and class-agnostic operations, leading to limited diversity for augmented samples. To this end, we propose a novel semantic data augmentation algorithm to complement traditional approaches. The proposed method is inspired by the intriguing property that deep networks are effective in learning linearized features, i.e., certain directions in the deep feature space correspond to meaningful semantic transformations, e.g., changing the background or view angle of an object. Based on this observation, translating training samples along many such directions in the feature space can effectively augment the dataset for more diversity. To implement this idea, we first introduce a sampling based method to obtain semantically meaningful directions efficiently. Then, an upper bound of the expected cross-entropy (CE) loss on the augmented training set is derived by assuming the number of augmented samples goes to infinity, yielding a highly efficient algorithm. In fact, we show that the proposed implicit semantic data augmentation (ISDA) algorithm amounts to minimizing a novel robust CE loss, which adds minimal extra computational cost to a normal training procedure. In addition to supervised learning, ISDA can be applied to semi-supervised learning tasks under the consistency regularization framework, where ISDA amounts to minimizing the upper bound of the expected KL-divergence between the augmented features and the original features. Although being simple, ISDA consistently improves the generalization performance of popular deep models (e.g., ResNets and DenseNets) on a variety of datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, ImageNet, Cityscapes and MS COCO.      
### 43.DeepCorn: A Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Method for High-Throughput Image-Based Corn Kernel Counting and Yield Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10521.pdf)
>  The success of modern farming and plant breeding relies on accurate and efficient collection of data. For a commercial organization that manages large amounts of crops, collecting accurate and consistent data is a bottleneck. Due to limited time and labor, accurately phenotyping crops to record color, head count, height, weight, etc. is severely limited. However, this information, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, is vital for developing new superior crop species that help feed the world's growing population. Recent advances in machine learning, in particular deep learning, have shown promise in mitigating this bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning method for counting on-ear corn kernels in-field to aid in the gathering of real-time data and, ultimately, to improve decision making to maximize yield. We name this approach DeepCorn, and show that this framework is robust under various conditions and can accurately and efficiently count corn kernels. We also adopt a semi-supervised learning approach to further improve the performance of our proposed method. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art methods.      
### 44.Sorted Pooling in Convolutional Networks for One-shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10495.pdf)
>  We present generalized versions of the commonly used maximum pooling operation: $k$th maximum and sorted pooling operations which selects the $k$th largest response in each pooling region, selecting locally consistent features of the input images. This method is able to increase the generalization power of a network and can be used to decrease training time and error rate of networks and it can significantly improve accuracy in case of training scenarios where the amount of available data is limited, like one-shot learning scenarios      
### 45.AdvFoolGen: Creating Persistent Troubles for Deep Classifiers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10485.pdf)
>  Researches have shown that deep neural networks are vulnerable to malicious attacks, where adversarial images are created to trick a network into misclassification even if the images may give rise to totally different labels by human eyes. To make deep networks more robust to such attacks, many defense mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, some of which are quite effective for guarding against typical attacks. In this paper, we present a new black-box attack termed AdvFoolGen, which can generate attacking images from the same feature space as that of the natural images, so as to keep baffling the network even though state-of-the-art defense mechanisms have been applied. We systematically evaluate our model by comparing with well-established attack algorithms. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our attack in the face of state-of-the-art defense techniques and unveil the potential reasons for its effectiveness through principled analysis. As such, AdvFoolGen contributes to understanding the vulnerability of deep networks from a new perspective and may, in turn, help in developing and evaluating new defense mechanisms.      
### 46.Points2Surf: Learning Implicit Surfaces from Point Cloud Patches  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10453.pdf)
>  A key step in any scanning-based asset creation workflow is to convert unordered point clouds to a surface. Classical methods (e.g., Poisson reconstruction) start to degrade in the presence of noisy and partial scans. Hence, deep learning based methods have recently been proposed to produce complete surfaces, even from partial scans. However, such data-driven methods struggle to generalize to new shapes with large geometric and topological variations. We present Points2Surf, a novel patch-based learning framework that produces accurate surfaces directly from raw scans without normals. Learning a prior over a combination of detailed local patches and coarse global information improves generalization performance and reconstruction accuracy. Our extensive comparison on both synthetic and real data demonstrates a clear advantage of our method over state-of-the-art alternatives on previously unseen classes (on average, Points2Surf brings down reconstruction error by 30\% over SPR and by 270\%+ over deep learning based SotA methods) at the cost of longer computation times and a slight increase in small-scale topological noise in some cases.

### 47.PDO-eConvs: Partial Differential Operator Based Equivariant Convolutions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10408.pdf)
>  Recent research has shown that incorporating equivariance into neural network architectures is very helpful, and there have been some works investigating the equivariance of networks under group actions. However, as digital images and feature maps are on the discrete meshgrid, corresponding equivariance-preserving transformation groups are very limited. In this work, we deal with this issue from the connection between convolutions and partial differential operators (PDOs). In theory, assuming inputs to be smooth, we transform PDOs and propose a system which is equivariant to a much more general continuous group, the $n$-dimension Euclidean group. In implementation, we discretize the system using the numerical schemes of PDOs, deriving approximately equivariant convolutions (PDO-eConvs). Theoretically, the approximation error of PDO-eConvs is of the quadratic order. It is the first time that the error analysis is provided when the equivariance is approximate. Extensive experiments on rotated MNIST and natural image classification show that PDO-eConvs perform competitively yet use parameters much more efficiently. Particularly, compared with Wide ResNets, our methods result in better results using only 12.6% parameters.      
### 48.NSGANetV2: Evolutionary Multi-Objective Surrogate-Assisted Neural Architecture Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10396.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose an efficient NAS algorithm for generating task-specific models that are competitive under multiple competing objectives. It comprises of two surrogates, one at the architecture level to improve sample efficiency and one at the weights level, through a supernet, to improve gradient descent training efficiency. On standard benchmark datasets (C10, C100, ImageNet), the resulting models, dubbed NSGANetV2, either match or outperform models from existing approaches with the search being orders of magnitude more sample efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method on six diverse non-standard datasets, e.g. STL-10, Flowers102, Oxford Pets, FGVC Aircrafts etc. In all cases, NSGANetV2s improve the state-of-the-art (under mobile setting), suggesting that NAS can be a viable alternative to conventional transfer learning approaches in handling diverse scenarios such as small-scale or fine-grained datasets.

### 49.Generative Hierarchical Features from Synthesizing Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10379.pdf)
>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently advanced image synthesis by learning the underlying distribution of observed data in an unsupervised manner. However, how the features trained from solving the task of image synthesis are applicable to visual tasks remains seldom explored. In this work, we show that learning to synthesize images is able to bring remarkable hierarchical visual features that are generalizable across a wide range of visual tasks. Specifically, we consider the pre-trained StyleGAN generator as a learned loss function and utilize its layer-wise disentangled representation to train a novel hierarchical encoder. As a result, the visual feature produced by our encoder, termed as Generative Hierarchical Feature (GH-Feat), has compelling discriminative and disentangled properties, facilitating a range of both discriminative and generative tasks. Extensive experiments on face verification, landmark detection, layout prediction, transfer learning, style mixing, and image editing show the appealing performance of the GH-Feat learned from synthesizing images, outperforming existing unsupervised feature learning methods.      
### 50.Privacy Preserving Visual SLAM  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10361.pdf)
>  This study proposes a privacy-preserving Visual SLAM framework for estimating camera poses and performing bundle adjustment with mixed line and point clouds in real time. Previous studies have proposed localization methods to estimate a camera pose using a line-cloud map for a single image or a reconstructed point cloud. These methods offer a scene privacy protection against the inversion attacks by converting a point cloud to a line cloud, which reconstruct the scene images from the point cloud. However, they are not directly applicable to a video sequence because they do not address computational efficiency. This is a critical issue to solve for estimating camera poses and performing bundle adjustment with mixed line and point clouds in real time. Moreover, there has been no study on a method to optimize a line-cloud map of a server with a point cloud reconstructed from a client video because any observation points on the image coordinates are not available to prevent the inversion attacks, namely the reversibility of the 3D lines. The experimental results with synthetic and real data show that our Visual SLAM framework achieves the intended privacy-preserving formation and real-time performance using a line-cloud map.      
### 51.Towards Nonlinear Disentanglement in Natural Data with Temporal Sparse Coding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10930.pdf)
>  We construct an unsupervised learning model that achieves nonlinear disentanglement of underlying factors of variation in naturalistic videos. Previous work suggests that representations can be disentangled if all but a few factors in the environment stay constant at any point in time. As a result, algorithms proposed for this problem have only been tested on carefully constructed datasets with this exact property, leaving it unclear whether they will transfer to natural scenes. Here we provide evidence that objects in segmented natural movies undergo transitions that are typically small in magnitude with occasional large jumps, which is characteristic of a temporally sparse distribution. We leverage this finding and present SlowVAE, a model for unsupervised representation learning that uses a sparse prior on temporally adjacent observations to disentangle generative factors without any assumptions on the number of changing factors. We provide a proof of identifiability and show that the model reliably learns disentangled representations on several established benchmark datasets, often surpassing the current state-of-the-art. We additionally demonstrate transferability towards video datasets with natural dynamics, Natural Sprites and KITTI Masks, which we contribute as benchmarks for guiding disentanglement research towards more natural data domains.      
### 52.Statistical Downscaling of Temperature Distributions from the Synoptic Scale to the Mesoscale Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10839.pdf)
>  Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks for image recognition, has been recently used in meteorology. One of the promising applications is developing a statistical surrogate model that converts the output images of low-resolution dynamic models to high-resolution images. Our study exhibits a preliminary experiment that evaluates the performance of a model that downscales synoptic temperature fields to mesoscale temperature fields every 6 hours. The deep learning model was trained with operational 22-km gridded global analysis surface winds and temperatures as the input, operational 5-km gridded regional analysis surface temperatures as the desired output, and a target domain covering central Japan. The results confirm that our deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is capable of estimating the locations of coastlines and mountain ridges in great detail, which are not retained in the inputs, and providing high-resolution surface temperature distributions. For instance, while the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 2.7 K between the global and regional analyses at altitudes greater than 1000 m, the RMSE is reduced to 1.0 K, and the correlation coefficient is improved from 0.6 to 0.9 by the surrogate model. Although this study evaluates a surrogate model only for surface temperature, it probably can be improved by augmenting the downscaling variables and vertical profiles. Surrogate models of DCNNs require only a small amount of computational power once their training is finished. Therefore, if the surrogate models are implemented at short time intervals, they will provide high-resolution weather forecast guidance or environment emergency alerts at low cost.      
### 53.IITK at SemEval-2020 Task 8: Unimodal and Bimodal Sentiment Analysis of Internet Memes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10822.pdf)
>  Social media is abundant in visual and textual information presented together or in isolation. Memes are the most popular form, belonging to the former class. In this paper, we present our approaches for the Memotion Analysis problem as posed in SemEval-2020 Task 8. The goal of this task is to classify memes based on their emotional content and sentiment. We leverage techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) towards the sentiment classification of internet memes (Subtask A). We consider Bimodal (text and image) as well as Unimodal (text-only) techniques in our study ranging from the Naïve Bayes classifier to Transformer-based approaches. Our results show that a text-only approach, a simple Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) with Word2vec embeddings as input, performs superior to all the others. We stand first in the Sentiment analysis task with a relative improvement of 63% over the baseline macro-F1 score. Our work is relevant to any task concerned with the combination of different modalities.      
### 54.Anomaly Detection in Unsupervised Surveillance Setting Using Ensemble of Multimodal Data with Adversarial Defense  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10812.pdf)
>  Autonomous aerial surveillance using drone feed is an interesting and challenging research domain. To ensure safety from intruders and potential objects posing threats to the zone being protected, it is crucial to be able to distinguish between normal and abnormal states in real-time. Additionally, we also need to consider any device malfunction. However, the inherent uncertainty embedded within the type and level of abnormality makes supervised techniques less suitable since the adversary may present a unique anomaly for intrusion. As a result, an unsupervised method for anomaly detection is preferable taking the unpredictable nature of attacks into account. Again in our case, the autonomous drone provides heterogeneous data streams consisting of images and other analog or digital sensor data, all of which can play a role in anomaly detection if they are ensembled synergistically. To that end, an ensemble detection mechanism is proposed here which estimates the degree of abnormality of analyzing the real-time image and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor data in an unsupervised manner. First, we have implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression block, named AngleNet to estimate the angle between a reference image and current test image, which provides us with a measure of the anomaly of the device. Moreover, the IMU data are used in autoencoders to predict abnormality. Finally, the results from these two pipelines are ensembled to estimate the final degree of abnormality. Furthermore, we have applied adversarial attack to test the robustness and security of the proposed approach and integrated defense mechanism. The proposed method performs satisfactorily on the IEEE SP Cup-2020 dataset with an accuracy of 97.8%. Additionally, we have also tested this approach on an in-house dataset to validate its robustness.      
### 55.Probabilistic Neighbourhood Component Analysis: Sample Efficient Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10800.pdf)
>  While Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in various applications, they often fall short in accurately estimating their predictive uncertainty and, in turn, fail to recognize when these predictions may be wrong. Several uncertainty-aware models, such as Bayesian Neural Network (BNNs) and Deep Ensembles have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty. However, research in this area has been largely confined to the big data regime. In this work, we show that the uncertainty estimation capability of state-of-the-art BNNs and Deep Ensemble models degrades significantly when the amount of training data is small. To address the issue of accurate uncertainty estimation in the small-data regime, we propose a probabilistic generalization of the popular sample-efficient non-parametric kNN approach. Our approach enables deep kNN classifier to accurately quantify underlying uncertainties in its prediction. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach by achieving superior uncertainty quantification as compared to state-of-the-art on a real-world application of COVID-19 diagnosis from chest X-Rays.

### 56.Label-free detection of Giardia lamblia cysts using a deep learning-enabled portable imaging flow cytometer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10795.pdf)
>  We report a field-portable and cost-effective imaging flow cytometer that uses deep learning to accurately detect Giardia lamblia cysts in water samples at a volumetric throughput of 100 mL/h. This flow cytometer uses lensfree color holographic imaging to capture and reconstruct phase and intensity images of microscopic objects in a continuously flowing sample, and automatically identifies Giardia Lamblia cysts in real-time without the use of any labels or fluorophores. The imaging flow cytometer is housed in an environmentally-sealed enclosure with dimensions of 19 cm x 19 cm x 16 cm and weighs 1.6 kg. We demonstrate that this portable imaging flow cytometer coupled to a laptop computer can detect and quantify, in real-time, low levels of Giardia contamination (e.g., &lt;10 cysts per 50 mL) in both freshwater and seawater samples. The field-portable and label-free nature of this method has the potential to allow rapid and automated screening of drinking water supplies in resource limited settings in order to detect waterborne parasites and monitor the integrity of the filters used for water treatment.      
### 57.Learning to Match Distributions for Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10791.pdf)
>  When the training and test data are from different distributions, domain adaptation is needed to reduce dataset bias to improve the model's generalization ability. Since it is difficult to directly match the cross-domain joint distributions, existing methods tend to reduce the marginal or conditional distribution divergence using predefined distances such as MMD and adversarial-based discrepancies. However, it remains challenging to determine which method is suitable for a given application since they are built with certain priors or bias. Thus they may fail to uncover the underlying relationship between transferable features and joint distributions. This paper proposes Learning to Match (L2M) to automatically learn the cross-domain distribution matching without relying on hand-crafted priors on the matching loss. Instead, L2M reduces the inductive bias by using a meta-network to learn the distribution matching loss in a data-driven way. L2M is a general framework that unifies task-independent and human-designed matching features. We design a novel optimization algorithm for this challenging objective with self-supervised label propagation. Experiments on public datasets substantiate the superiority of L2M over SOTA methods. Moreover, we apply L2M to transfer from pneumonia to COVID-19 chest X-ray images with remarkable performance. L2M can also be extended in other distribution matching applications where we show in a trial experiment that L2M generates more realistic and sharper MNIST samples.      
### 58.Backdoor Attacks and Countermeasures on Deep Learning: A Comprehensive Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10760.pdf)
>  This work provides the community with a timely comprehensive review of backdoor attacks and countermeasures on deep learning. According to the attacker's capability and affected stage of the machine learning pipeline, the attack surfaces are recognized to be wide and then formalized into six categorizations: code poisoning, outsourcing, pretrained, data collection, collaborative learning and post-deployment. Accordingly, attacks under each categorization are combed. The countermeasures are categorized into four general classes: blind backdoor removal, offline backdoor inspection, online backdoor inspection, and post backdoor removal. Accordingly, we review countermeasures, and compare and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We have also reviewed the flip side of backdoor attacks, which are explored for i) protecting intellectual property of deep learning models and ii) acting as a honeypot to trap adversarial example attacks. Overall, the defense is regarded far behind the attack, there is no single defense that can prevent all types of backdoor attacks. In some cases, an adaptive attack can easily bypass existing defenses. We also consider key areas for future research on the backdoor, such as empirical security evaluations from physical trigger attacks, and in particular, more efficient and practical countermeasures are solicited.      
### 59.Balanced Meta-Softmax for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10740.pdf)
>  Deep classifiers have achieved great success in visual recognition. However, real-world data is long-tailed by nature, leading to the mismatch between training and testing distributions. In this paper, we show that Softmax function, though used in most classification tasks, gives a biased gradient estimation under the long-tailed setup. This paper presents Balanced Softmax, an elegant unbiased extension of Softmax, to accommodate the label distribution shift between training and testing. Theoretically, we derive the generalization bound for multiclass Softmax regression and show our loss minimizes the bound. In addition, we introduce Balanced Meta-Softmax, applying a complementary Meta Sampler to estimate the optimal class sample rate and further improve long-tailed learning. In our experiments, we demonstrate that Balanced Meta-Softmax outperforms state-of-the-art long-tailed classification solutions on both visual recognition and instance segmentation tasks.      
### 60.Optimization of data-driven filterbank for automatic speaker verification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10729.pdf)
>  Most of the speech processing applications use triangular filters spaced in mel-scale for feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a new data-driven filter design method which optimizes filter parameters from a given speech data. First, we introduce a frame-selection based approach for developing speech-signal-based frequency warping scale. Then, we propose a new method for computing the filter frequency responses by using principal component analysis (PCA). The main advantage of the proposed method over the recently introduced deep learning based methods is that it requires very limited amount of unlabeled speech-data. We demonstrate that the proposed filterbank has more speaker discriminative power than commonly used mel filterbank as well as existing data-driven filterbank. We conduct automatic speaker verification (ASV) experiments with different corpora using various classifier back-ends. We show that the acoustic features created with proposed filterbank are better than existing mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and speech-signal-based frequency cepstral coefficients (SFCCs) in most cases. In the experiments with VoxCeleb1 and popular i-vector back-end, we observe 9.75% relative improvement in equal error rate (EER) over MFCCs. Similarly, the relative improvement is 4.43% with recently introduced x-vector system. We obtain further improvement using fusion of the proposed method with standard MFCC-based approach.      
### 61.Fully Automated Segmentation of the Left Ventricle in Magnetic Resonance Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10665.pdf)
>  Automatic and robust segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in magnetic resonance images (MRI) has remained challenging for many decades. With the great success of deep learning in object detection and classification, the research focus of LV segmentation has changed to convolutional neural network (CNN) in recent years. However, LV segmentation is a pixel-level classification problem and its categories are intractable compared to object detection and classification. Although lots of CNN based methods have been proposed for LV segmentation, no robust and reproducible results are achieved yet. In this paper, we try to reproduce the CNN based LV segmentation methods with their disclosed codes and trained CNN models. Not surprisingly, the reproduced results are significantly worse than their claimed accuracies. We also proposed a fully automated LV segmentation method based on slope difference distribution (SDD) threshold selection to compare with the reproduced CNN methods. The proposed method achieved 95.44% DICE score on the test set of automated cardiac diagnosis challenge (ACDC) while the two compared CNN methods achieved 90.28% and 87.13% DICE scores. Our achieved accuracy is also higher than the best accuracy reported in the published literatures. The MATLAB codes of our proposed method are freely available on line.      
### 62.SLNSpeech: solving extended speech separation problem by the help of sign language  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10629.pdf)
>  A speech separation task can be roughly divided into audio-only separation and audio-visual separation. In order to make speech separation technology applied in the real scenario of the disabled, this paper presents an extended speech separation problem which refers in particular to sign language assisted speech separation. However, most existing datasets for speech separation are audios and videos which contain audio and/or visual modalities. To address the extended speech separation problem, we introduce a large-scale dataset named Sign Language News Speech (SLNSpeech) dataset in which three modalities of audio, visual, and sign language are coexisted. Then, we design a general deep learning network for the self-supervised learning of three modalities, particularly, using sign language embeddings together with audio or audio-visual information for better solving the speech separation task. Specifically, we use 3D residual convolutional network to extract sign language features and use pretrained VGGNet model to exact visual features. After that, an improved U-Net with skip connections in feature extraction stage is applied for learning the embeddings among the mixed spectrogram transformed from source audios, the sign language features and visual features. Experiments results show that, besides visual modality, sign language modality can also be used alone to supervise speech separation task. Moreover, we also show the effectiveness of sign language assisted speech separation when the visual modality is disturbed. Source code will be released in http://cheertt.top/homepage/      
### 63.Sparse Nonnegative Tensor Factorization and Completion with Noisy Observations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10626.pdf)
>  In this paper, we study the sparse nonnegative tensor factorization and completion problem from partial and noisy observations for third-order tensors. Because of sparsity and nonnegativity, the underling tensor is decomposed into the tensor-tensor product of one sparse nonnegative tensor and one nonnegative tensor. We propose to minimize the sum of the maximum likelihood estimate for the observations with nonnegativity constraints and the tensor $\ell_0$ norm for the sparse factor. We show that the error bounds of the estimator of the proposed model can be established under general noise observations. The detailed error bounds under specific noise distributions including additive Gaussian noise, additive Laplace noise, and Poisson observations can be derived. Moreover, the minimax lower bounds are shown to be matched with the established upper bounds up to a logarithmic factor of the sizes of the underlying tensor. These theoretical results for tensors are better than those obtained for matrices, and this illustrates the advantage of the use of nonnegative sparse tensor models for completion and denoising. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the superiority of the proposed tensor-based method compared with the matrix-based approach.      
### 64.Towards Visual Distortion in Black-Box Attacks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10593.pdf)
>  Constructing adversarial examples in a black-box threat model injures the original images by introducing visual distortion. In this paper, we propose a novel black-box attack approach that can directly minimize the induced distortion by learning the noise distribution of the adversarial example, assuming only loss-oracle access to the black-box network. The quantified visual distortion, which measures the perceptual distance between the adversarial example and the original image, is introduced in our loss whilst the gradient of the corresponding non-differentiable loss function is approximated by sampling noise from the learned noise distribution. We validate the effectiveness of our attack on ImageNet. Our attack results in much lower distortion when compared to the state-of-the-art black-box attacks and achieves $100\%$ success rate on ResNet50 and VGG16bn.

### 65.Effects of Approximate Multiplication on Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10500.pdf)
>  This paper analyzes the effects of approximate multiplication when performing inferences on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The approximate multiplication can reduce the cost of underlying circuits so that CNN inferences can be performed more efficiently in hardware accelerators. The study identifies the critical factors in the convolution, fully-connected, and batch normalization layers that allow more accurate CNN predictions despite the errors from approximate multiplication. The same factors also provide an arithmetic explanation of why bfloat16 multiplication performs well on CNNs. The experiments are performed with recognized network architectures to show that the approximate multipliers can produce predictions that are nearly as accurate as the FP32 references, without additional training. For example, the ResNet and Inception-v4 models with Mitch-$w$6 multiplication produces Top-5 errors that are within 0.2% compared to the FP32 references. A brief cost comparison of Mitch-$w$6 against bfloat16 is presented, where a MAC operation saves up to 80% of energy compared to the bfloat16 arithmetic. The most far-reaching contribution of this paper is the analytical justification that multiplications can be approximated while additions need to be exact in CNN MAC operations.      
### 66.Deep multi-metric learning for text-independent speaker verification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10479.pdf)
>  Text-independent speaker verification is an important artificial intelligence problem that has a wide spectrum of applications, such as criminal investigation, payment certification, and interest-based customer services. The purpose of text-independent speaker verification is to determine whether two given uncontrolled utterances originate from the same speaker or not. Extracting speech features for each speaker using deep neural networks is a promising direction to explore and a straightforward solution is to train the discriminative feature extraction network by using a metric learning loss function. However, a single loss function often has certain limitations. Thus, we use deep multi-metric learning to address the problem and introduce three different losses for this problem, i.e., triplet loss, n-pair loss and angular loss. The three loss functions work in a cooperative way to train a feature extraction network equipped with Residual connections and squeeze-and-excitation attention. We conduct experiments on the large-scale \texttt{VoxCeleb2} dataset, which contains over a million utterances from over $6,000$ speakers, and the proposed deep neural network obtains an equal error rate of $3.48\%$, which is a very competitive result. Codes for both training and testing and pretrained models are available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/GreatJiweix/DmmlTiSV" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}, which is the first publicly available code repository for large-scale text-independent speaker verification with performance on par with the state-of-the-art systems.      
### 67.Active MR k-space Sampling with Reinforcement Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10469.pdf)
>  Deep learning approaches have recently shown great promise in accelerating magnetic resonance image (MRI) acquisition. The majority of existing work have focused on designing better reconstruction models given a pre-determined acquisition trajectory, ignoring the question of trajectory optimization. In this paper, we focus on learning acquisition trajectories given a fixed image reconstruction model. We formulate the problem as a sequential decision process and propose the use of reinforcement learning to solve it. Experiments on a large scale public MRI dataset of knees show that our proposed models significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in active MRI acquisition, over a large range of acceleration factors.      
### 68.Second-Order Pooling for Graph Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10467.pdf)
>  Graph neural networks have achieved great success in learning node representations for graph tasks such as node classification and link prediction. Graph representation learning requires graph pooling to obtain graph representations from node representations. It is challenging to develop graph pooling methods due to the variable sizes and isomorphic structures of graphs. In this work, we propose to use second-order pooling as graph pooling, which naturally solves the above challenges. In addition, compared to existing graph pooling methods, second-order pooling is able to use information from all nodes and collect second-order statistics, making it more powerful. We show that direct use of second-order pooling with graph neural networks leads to practical problems. To overcome these problems, we propose two novel global graph pooling methods based on second-order pooling; namely, bilinear mapping and attentional second-order pooling. In addition, we extend attentional second-order pooling to hierarchical graph pooling for more flexible use in GNNs. We perform thorough experiments on graph classification tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed methods. Experimental results show that our methods improve the performance significantly and consistently.      
### 69.Detection, Attribution and Localization of GAN Generated Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10466.pdf)
>  Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have led to the creation of realistic-looking digital images that pose a major challenge to their detection by humans or computers. GANs are used in a wide range of tasks, from modifying small attributes of an image (StarGAN [14]), transferring attributes between image pairs (CycleGAN [91]), as well as generating entirely new images (ProGAN [36], StyleGAN [37], SPADE/GauGAN [64]). In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect, attribute and localize GAN generated images that combines image features with deep learning methods. For every image, co-occurrence matrices are computed on neighborhood pixels of RGB channels in different directions (horizontal, vertical and diagonal). A deep learning network is then trained on these features to detect, attribute and localize these GAN generated/manipulated images. A large scale evaluation of our approach on 5 GAN datasets comprising over 2.76 million images (ProGAN, StarGAN, CycleGAN, StyleGAN and SPADE/GauGAN) shows promising results in detecting GAN generated images.      
### 70.Integrative Analysis for COVID-19 Patient Outcome Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10416.pdf)
>  While image analysis of chest computed tomography (CT) for COVID-19 diagnosis has been intensively studied, little work has been performed for image-based patient outcome prediction. Management of high-risk patients with early intervention is a key to lower the fatality rate of COVID-19 pneumonia, as a majority of patients recover naturally. Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management. In lieu of only size and volume information of pulmonary abnormalities and features through deep learning based image segmentation, here we combine radiomics of lung opacities and non-imaging features from demographic data, vital signs, and laboratory findings to predict need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses holistic information of a patient including both imaging and non-imaging data for outcome prediction. The proposed methods were thoroughly evaluated on datasets separately collected from three hospitals, one in the United States, one in Iran, and another in Italy, with a total 295 patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay positive COVID-19 pneumonia. Our experimental results demonstrate that adding non-imaging features can significantly improve the performance of prediction to achieve AUC up to 0.884 and sensitivity as high as 96.1%, which can be valuable to provide clinical decision support in managing COVID-19 patients. Our methods may also be applied to other lung diseases including but not limited to community acquired pneumonia.      
### 71.Learning to Prune Deep Neural Networks via Reinforcement Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.04756.pdf)
>  This paper proposes PuRL - a deep reinforcement learning (RL) based algorithm for pruning neural networks. Unlike current RL based model compression approaches where feedback is given only at the end of each episode to the agent, PuRL provides rewards at every pruning step. This enables PuRL to achieve sparsity and accuracy comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, while having a much shorter training cycle. PuRL achieves more than 80% sparsity on the ResNet-50 model while retaining a Top-1 accuracy of 75.37% on the ImageNet dataset. Through our experiments we show that PuRL is also able to sparsify already efficient architectures like MobileNet-V2. In addition to performance characterisation experiments, we also provide a discussion and analysis of the various RL design choices that went into the tuning of the Markov Decision Process underlying PuRL. Lastly, we point out that PuRL is simple to use and can be easily adapted for various architectures.
