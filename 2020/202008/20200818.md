### 1.V2VNet: Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication for Joint Perception and Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07519.pdf)
>  In this paper, we explore the use of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to improve the perception and motion forecasting performance of self-driving vehicles. By intelligently aggregating the information received from multiple nearby vehicles, we can observe the same scene from different viewpoints. This allows us to see through occlusions and detect actors at long range, where the observations are very sparse or non-existent. We also show that our approach of sending compressed deep feature map activations achieves high accuracy while satisfying communication bandwidth requirements.      
### 2.Source Free Domain Adaptation with Image Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07514.pdf)
>  Effort in releasing large-scale datasets may be compromised by privacy and intellectual property considerations. A feasible alternative is to release pre-trained models instead. While these models are strong on their original task (source domain), their performance might degrade significantly when deployed directly in a new environment (target domain), which might not contain labels for training under realistic settings. Domain adaptation (DA) is a known solution to the domain gap problem, but usually requires labeled source data. In this paper, we study the problem of source free domain adaptation (SFDA), whose distinctive feature is that the source domain only provides a pre-trained model, but no source data. Being source free adds significant challenges to DA, especially when considering that the target dataset is unlabeled. To solve the SFDA problem, we propose an image translation approach that transfers the style of target images to that of unseen source images. To this end, we align the batch-wise feature statistics of generated images to that stored in batch normalization layers of the pre-trained model. Compared with directly classifying target images, higher accuracy is obtained with these style transferred images using the pre-trained model. On several image classification datasets, we show that the above-mentioned improvements are consistent and statistically significant.      
### 3.Zero Shot Domain Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07443.pdf)
>  Standard supervised learning setting assumes that training data and test data come from the same distribution (domain). Domain generalization (DG) methods try to learn a model that when trained on data from multiple domains, would generalize to a new unseen domain. We extend DG to an even more challenging setting, where the label space of the unseen domain could also change. We introduce this problem as Zero-Shot Domain Generalization (to the best of our knowledge, the first such effort), where the model generalizes across new domains and also across new classes in those domains. We propose a simple strategy which effectively exploits semantic information of classes, to adapt existing DG methods to meet the demands of Zero-Shot Domain Generalization. We evaluate the proposed methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, F-MNIST and PACS datasets, establishing a strong baseline to foster interest in this new research direction.      
### 4.Hey Human, If your Facial Emotions are Uncertain, You Should Use Bayesian Neural Networks!  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07426.pdf)
>  Facial emotion recognition is the task to classify human emotions in face images. It is a difficult task due to high aleatoric uncertainty and visual ambiguity. A large part of the literature aims to show progress by increasing accuracy on this task, but this ignores the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity in the task. In this paper we show that Bayesian Neural Networks, as approximated using MC-Dropout, MC-DropConnect, or an Ensemble, are able to model the aleatoric uncertainty in facial emotion recognition, and produce output probabilities that are closer to what a human expects. We also show that calibration metrics show strange behaviors for this task, due to the multiple classes that can be considered correct, which motivates future work. We believe our work will motivate other researchers to move away from Classical and into Bayesian Neural Networks.      
### 5.Improving Emergency Response during Hurricane Season using Computer Vision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07418.pdf)
>  We have developed a framework for crisis response and management that incorporates the latest technologies in computer vision (CV), inland flood prediction, damage assessment and data visualization. The framework uses data collected before, during, and after the crisis to enable rapid and informed decision making during all phases of disaster response. Our computer-vision model analyzes spaceborne and airborne imagery to detect relevant features during and after a natural disaster and creates metadata that is transformed into actionable information through web-accessible mapping tools. In particular, we have designed an ensemble of models to identify features including water, roads, buildings, and vegetation from the imagery. We have investigated techniques to bootstrap and reduce dependency on large data annotation efforts by adding use of open source labels including OpenStreetMaps and adding complementary data sources including Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) as a side channel to the network's input to encourage it to learn other features orthogonal to visual characteristics. Modeling efforts include modification of connected U-Nets for (1) semantic segmentation, (2) flood line detection, and (3) for damage assessment. In particular for the case of damage assessment, we added a second encoder to U-Net so that it could learn pre-event and post-event image features simultaneously. Through this method, the network is able to learn the difference between the pre- and post-disaster images, and therefore more effectively classify the level of damage. We have validated our approaches using publicly available data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Remote Sensing Division, which displays the city and street-level details as mosaic tile images as well as data released as part of the Xview2 challenge.      
### 6.Spatial Temporal Transformer Network for Skeleton-based Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07404.pdf)
>  Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has achieved a great interest in recent years, as skeleton data has been demonstrated to be robust to illumination changes, body scales, dynamic camera views and complex background. In particular, Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN) demonstrated to be effective in learning both spatial and temporal dependencies on non-Euclidean data such as skeleton graphs. Nevertheless, an effective encoding of the latent information underlying the 3D skeleton is still an open problem, especially how to extract effective information from joint motion patterns and their correlations. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Transformer network (ST-TR) which models dependencies between joints using the Transformer self-attention operator. In our ST-TR model a Spatial Self-Attention module (SSA) is used to understand intra-frame interactions between different body parts, and a Temporal Self-Attention module (TSA) to model inter-frame correlations. The two are combined in a two-stream network, whose performance is evaluated on three large-scale datasets, NTU-RGB+D 60, NTU-RGB+D 120 and Kinetics Skeleton 400, outperforming the state-of-the-art on NTU-RGB+D w.r.t. models using the same input data consisting of joint information.      
### 7.Rotation-Invariant Gait Identification with Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07393.pdf)
>  A desireable property of accelerometric gait-based identification systems is robustness to new device orientations presented by users during testing but unseen during the training phase. However, traditional Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used in these systems compensate poorly for such transformations. In this paper, we target this problem by introducing Quaternion CNN, a network architecture which is intrinsically layer-wise equivariant and globally invariant under 3D rotations of an array of input vectors. We show empirically that this network indeed significantly outperforms a traditional CNN in a multi-user rotation-invariant gait classification setting .Lastly, we demonstrate how the kernels learned by this QCNN can also be visualized as basis-independent but origin- and chirality-dependent trajectory fragments in the euclidean space, thus yielding a novel mode of feature visualization and extraction.      
### 8.SoftPoolNet: Shape Descriptor for Point Cloud Completion and Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07358.pdf)
>  Point clouds are often the default choice for many applications as they exhibit more flexibility and efficiency than volumetric data. Nevertheless, their unorganized nature -- points are stored in an unordered way -- makes them less suited to be processed by deep learning pipelines. In this paper, we propose a method for 3D object completion and classification based on point clouds. We introduce a new way of organizing the extracted features based on their activations, which we name soft pooling. For the decoder stage, we propose regional convolutions, a novel operator aimed at maximizing the global activation entropy. Furthermore, inspired by the local refining procedure in Point Completion Network (PCN), we also propose a patch-deforming operation to simulate deconvolutional operations for point clouds. This paper proves that our regional activation can be incorporated in many point cloud architectures like AtlasNet and PCN, leading to better performance for geometric completion. We evaluate our approach on different 3D tasks such as object completion and classification, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.      
### 9.AP-Loss for Accurate One-Stage Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07294.pdf)
>  One-stage object detectors are trained by optimizing classification-loss and localization-loss simultaneously, with the former suffering much from extreme foreground-background class imbalance issue due to the large number of anchors. This paper alleviates this issue by proposing a novel framework to replace the classification task in one-stage detectors with a ranking task, and adopting the Average-Precision loss (AP-loss) for the ranking problem. Due to its non-differentiability and non-convexity, the AP-loss cannot be optimized directly. For this purpose, we develop a novel optimization algorithm, which seamlessly combines the error-driven update scheme in perceptron learning and backpropagation algorithm in deep networks. We provide in-depth analyses on the good convergence property and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm, both theoretically and empirically. Experimental results demonstrate notable improvement in addressing the imbalance issue in object detection over existing AP-based optimization algorithms. An improved state-of-the-art performance is achieved in one-stage detectors based on AP-loss over detectors using classification-losses on various standard benchmarks. The proposed framework is also highly versatile in accommodating different network architectures.

### 10.An Improved Dilated Convolutional Network for Herd Counting in Crowded Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07254.pdf)
>  Crowd management technologies that leverage computer vision are widespread in contemporary times. There exists many security-related applications of these methods, including, but not limited to: following the flow of an array of people and monitoring large gatherings. In this paper, we propose an accurate monitoring system composed of two concatenated convolutional deep learning architectures. The first part called Front-end, is responsible for converting bi-dimensional signals and delivering high-level features. The second part, called the Back-end, is a dilated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used to replace pooling layers. It is responsible for enlarging the receptive field of the whole network and converting the descriptors provided by the first network to a saliency map that will be utilized to estimate the number of people in highly congested images. We also propose to utilize a genetic algorithm in order to find an optimized dilation rate configuration in the back-end. The proposed model is shown to converge 30\% faster than state-of-the-art approaches. It is also shown that it achieves 20\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) when applied to the Shanghai data~set.      
### 11.Self-Supervised Learning for Monocular Depth Estimation from Aerial Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07246.pdf)
>  Supervised learning based methods for monocular depth estimation usually require large amounts of extensively annotated training data. In the case of aerial imagery, this ground truth is particularly difficult to acquire. Therefore, in this paper, we present a method for self-supervised learning for monocular depth estimation from aerial imagery that does not require annotated training data. For this, we only use an image sequence from a single moving camera and learn to simultaneously estimate depth and pose information. By sharing the weights between pose and depth estimation, we achieve a relatively small model, which favors real-time application. We evaluate our approach on three diverse datasets and compare the results to conventional methods that estimate depth maps based on multi-view geometry. We achieve an accuracy {\delta}1.25 of up to 93.5 %. In addition, we have paid particular attention to the generalization of a trained model to unknown data and the self-improving capabilities of our approach. We conclude that, even though the results of monocular depth estimation are inferior to those achieved by conventional methods, they are well suited to provide a good initialization for methods that rely on image matching or to provide estimates in regions where image matching fails, e.g. occluded or texture-less regions.      
### 12.Multi-label Learning with Missing Values using Combined Facial Action Unit Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07234.pdf)
>  Facial action units allow an objective, standardized description of facial micro movements which can be used to describe emotions in human faces. Annotating data for action units is an expensive and time-consuming task, which leads to a scarce data situation. By combining multiple datasets from different studies, the amount of training data for a machine learning algorithm can be increased in order to create robust models for automated, multi-label action unit detection. However, every study annotates different action units, leading to a tremendous amount of missing labels in a combined database. In this work, we examine this challenge and present our approach to create a combined database and an algorithm capable of learning under the presence of missing labels without inferring their values. Our approach shows competitive performance compared to recent competitions in action unit detection.      
### 13.Category-Level 3D Non-Rigid Registration from Single-View RGB Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07203.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to solve the 3D non-rigid registration problem from RGB images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our objective is to find a deformation field (typically used for transferring knowledge between instances, e.g., grasping skills) that warps a given 3D canonical model into a novel instance observed by a single-view RGB image. This is done by training a CNN that infers a deformation field for the visible parts of the canonical model and by employing a learned shape (latent) space for inferring the deformations of the occluded parts. As result of the registration, the observed model is reconstructed. Because our method does not need depth information, it can register objects that are typically hard to perceive with RGB-D sensors, e.g. with transparent or shiny surfaces. Even without depth data, our approach outperforms the Coherent Point Drift (CPD) registration method for the evaluated object categories.      
### 14.White blood cell classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07181.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a novel automatic classification framework for the recognition of five types of white blood cells. Segmenting complete white blood cells from blood smears images and extracting advantageous features from them remain challenging tasks in the classification of white blood cells. Therefore, we present an adaptive threshold segmentation method to deal with blood smears images with non-uniform color and uneven illumination, which is designed based on color space information and threshold segmentation. Subsequently, after successfully separating the white blood cell from the blood smear image, a large number of nonlinear features including geometrical, color and texture features are extracted. Nevertheless, redundant features can affect the classification speed and efficiency, and in view of that, a feature selection algorithm based on classification and regression trees (CART) is designed. Through in-depth analysis of the nonlinear relationship between features, the irrelevant and redundant features are successfully removed from the initial nonlinear features. Afterwards, the selected prominent features are fed into particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM) classifier to recognize the types of the white blood cells. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the proposed white blood cell classification methodology, we build a white blood cell data set containing 500 blood smear images for experiments. By comparing with the ground truth obtained manually, the proposed segmentation method achieves an average of 95.98% and 97.57% dice similarity for segmented nucleus and cell regions respectively. Furthermore, the proposed methodology achieves 99.76% classification accuracy, which well demonstrates its effectiveness.      
### 15.DeepGIN: Deep Generative Inpainting Network for Extreme Image Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07173.pdf)
>  The degree of difficulty in image inpainting depends on the types and sizes of the missing parts. Existing image inpainting approaches usually encounter difficulties in completing the missing parts in the wild with pleasing visual and contextual results as they are trained for either dealing with one specific type of missing patterns (mask) or unilaterally assuming the shapes and/or sizes of the masked areas. We propose a deep generative inpainting network, named DeepGIN, to handle various types of masked images. We design a Spatial Pyramid Dilation (SPD) ResNet block to enable the use of distant features for reconstruction. We also employ Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) mechanism and Back Projection (BP) technique to enhance our inpainting results. Our DeepGIN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches generally, including two publicly available datasets (FFHQ and Oxford Buildings), both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also demonstrate that our model is capable of completing masked images in the wild.      
### 16.Neutral Face Game Character Auto-Creation via PokerFace-GAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07154.pdf)
>  Game character customization is one of the core features of many recent Role-Playing Games (RPGs), where players can edit the appearance of their in-game characters with their preferences. This paper studies the problem of automatically creating in-game characters with a single photo. In recent literature on this topic, neural networks are introduced to make game engine differentiable and the self-supervised learning is used to predict facial customization parameters. However, in previous methods, the expression parameters and facial identity parameters are highly coupled with each other, making it difficult to model the intrinsic facial features of the character. Besides, the neural network based renderer used in previous methods is also difficult to be extended to multi-view rendering cases. In this paper, considering the above problems, we propose a novel method named "PokerFace-GAN" for neutral face game character auto-creation. We first build a differentiable character renderer which is more flexible than the previous methods in multi-view rendering cases. We then take advantage of the adversarial training to effectively disentangle the expression parameters from the identity parameters and thus generate player-preferred neutral face (expression-less) characters. Since all components of our method are differentiable, our method can be easily trained under a multi-task self-supervised learning paradigm. Experiment results show that our method can generate vivid neutral face game characters that are highly similar to the input photos. The effectiveness of our method is verified by comparison results and ablation studies.      
### 17.Multi-organ Segmentation via Co-training Weight-averaged Models from Few-organ Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07149.pdf)
>  Multi-organ segmentation has extensive applications in many clinical applications. To segment multiple organs of interest, it is generally quite difficult to collect full annotations of all the organs on the same images, as some medical centers might only annotate a portion of the organs due to their own clinical practice. In most scenarios, one might obtain annotations of a single or a few organs from one training set, and obtain annotations of the the other organs from another set of training images. Existing approaches mostly train and deploy a single model for each subset of organs, which are memory intensive and also time inefficient. In this paper, we propose to co-train weight-averaged models for learning a unified multi-organ segmentation network from few-organ datasets. We collaboratively train two networks and let the coupled networks teach each other on un-annotated organs. To alleviate the noisy teaching supervisions between the networks, the weighted-averaged models are adopted to produce more reliable soft labels. In addition, a novel region mask is utilized to selectively apply the consistent constraint on the un-annotated organ regions that require collaborative teaching, which further boosts the performance. Extensive experiments on three public available single-organ datasets LiTS, KiTS, Pancreas and manually-constructed single-organ datasets from MOBA show that our method can better utilize the few-organ datasets and achieves superior performance with less inference computational cost.      
### 18.How to Train Your Robust Human Pose Estimator: Pay Attention to the Constraint Cue  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07139.pdf)
>  Both appearance cue and constraint cue are important in human pose estimation. However, the widely used response map supervision has the tendency to overfit the appearance cue and overlook the constraint cue. In this paper, we propose occlusion augmentation with customized training schedules to tackle this dilemma. Specifically, we implicitly force the neural network focus on the constraint cue by dropping appearance information within keypoint-aware strategy. Besides, a two-steps schedule is designed to deal with the information shortage in early training process, which effectively exploits the potential of the proposed occlusion augmentation. In experiments, as a model-agnostic approach, occlusion augmentation consistently promotes most SOTAs with different input sizes, frameworks, backbones, training and test sets. For HRNet within W32-256x192 and W48plus-384x288 configurations, occlusion augmentation obtains gains by 0.6 AP (75.6 to 76.2) and 0.7 AP (76.8 to 77.5) on COCO test-dev set, respectively. HRNet-W48plus-384x288 equipped with extra training data and occlusion augmentation achieves 78.7 AP. Furthermore, the proposed occlusion augmentation makes a remarkable improvement on more challenging CrowdPose dataset. The source code will be publicly available for further research in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/UDP-Pose" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 19.Fast and Robust Face-to-Parameter Translation for Game Character Auto-Creation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07132.pdf)
>  With the rapid development of Role-Playing Games (RPGs), players are now allowed to edit the facial appearance of their in-game characters with their preferences rather than using default templates. This paper proposes a game character auto-creation framework that generates in-game characters according to a player's input face photo. Different from the previous methods that are designed based on neural style transfer or monocular 3D face reconstruction, we re-formulate the character auto-creation process in a different point of view: by predicting a large set of physically meaningful facial parameters under a self-supervised learning paradigm. Instead of updating facial parameters iteratively at the input end of the renderer as suggested by previous methods, which are time-consuming, we introduce a facial parameter translator so that the creation can be done efficiently through a single forward propagation from the face embeddings to parameters, with a considerable 1000x computational speedup. Despite its high efficiency, the interactivity is preserved in our method where users are allowed to optionally fine-tune the facial parameters on our creation according to their needs. Our approach also shows better robustness than previous methods, especially for those photos with head-pose variance. Comparison results and ablation analysis on seven public face verification datasets suggest the effectiveness of our method.      
### 20.Reversing the cycle: self-supervised deep stereo through enhanced monocular distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07130.pdf)
>  In many fields, self-supervised learning solutions are rapidly evolving and filling the gap with supervised approaches. This fact occurs for depth estimation based on either monocular or stereo, with the latter often providing a valid source of self-supervision for the former. In contrast, to soften typical stereo artefacts, we propose a novel self-supervised paradigm reversing the link between the two. Purposely, in order to train deep stereo networks, we distill knowledge through a monocular completion network. This architecture exploits single-image clues and few sparse points, sourced by traditional stereo algorithms, to estimate dense yet accurate disparity maps by means of a consensus mechanism over multiple estimations. We thoroughly evaluate with popular stereo datasets the impact of different supervisory signals showing how stereo networks trained with our paradigm outperform existing self-supervised frameworks. Finally, our proposal achieves notable generalization capabilities dealing with domain shift issues.

### 21.Generative Design by Reinforcement Learning: Maximizing Diversity of Topology Optimized Designs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07119.pdf)
>  Generative design is a design exploration process in which a large number of structurally optimal designs are generated in parallel by diversifying parameters of the topology optimization while fulfilling certain constraints. Recently, data-driven generative design has gained much attention due to its integration with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. When generating new designs through a generative approach, one of the important evaluation factors is diversity. In general, the problem definition of topology optimization is diversified by varying the force and boundary conditions, and the diversity of the generated designs is influenced by such parameter combinations. This study proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based generative design process with reward functions maximizing the diversity of the designs. We formulate the generative design as a sequential problem of finding optimal parameter level values according to a given initial design. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) was applied as the learning framework, which is demonstrated in the case study of an automotive wheel design problem. This study also proposes the use of a deep neural network to instantly generate new designs without the topology optimization process, thus reducing the large computational burdens required by reinforcement learning. We show that RL-based generative design produces a large number of diverse designs within a short inference time by exploiting GPU in a fully automated manner. It is different from the previous approach using CPU which takes much more processing time and involving human intervention.      
### 22.WSRNet: Joint Spotting and Recognition of Handwritten Words  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07109.pdf)
>  In this work, we present a unified model that can handle both Keyword Spotting and Word Recognition with the same network architecture. The proposed network is comprised of a non-recurrent CTC branch and a Seq2Seq branch that is further augmented with an Autoencoding module. The related joint loss leads to a boost in recognition performance, while the Seq2Seq branch is used to create efficient word representations. We show how to further process these representations with binarization and a retraining scheme to provide compact and highly efficient descriptors, suitable for keyword spotting. Numerical results validate the usefulness of the proposed architecture, as our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in keyword spotting, and provides results in the ballpark of the leading methods for word recognition.      
### 23.Spherical coordinates transformation pre-processing in Deep Convolution Neural Networks for brain tumor segmentation in MRI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07090.pdf)
>  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used in everyday clinical practice to assess brain tumors. Several automatic or semi-automatic segmentation algorithms have been introduced to segment brain tumors and achieve an expert-like accuracy. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have recently shown very promising results, however, DCNN models are still far from achieving clinically meaningful results mainly because of the lack of generalization of the models. DCNN models need large annotated datasets to achieve good performance. Models are often optimized on the domain dataset on which they have been trained, and then fail the task when the same model is applied to different datasets from different institutions. One of the reasons is due to the lack of data standardization to adjust for different models and MR machines. In this work, a 3D Spherical coordinates transform during the pre-processing phase has been hypothesized to improve DCNN models' accuracy and to allow more generalizable results even when the model is trained on small and heterogeneous datasets and translated into different domains. Indeed, the spherical coordinate system avoids several standardization issues since it works independently of resolution and imaging settings. Both Cartesian and spherical volumes were evaluated in two DCNN models with the same network structure using the BraTS 2019 dataset. The model trained on spherical transform pre-processed inputs resulted in superior performance over the Cartesian-input trained model on predicting gliomas' segmentation on tumor core and enhancing tumor classes (increase of 0.011 and 0.014 respectively on the validation dataset), achieving a further improvement in accuracy by merging the two models together. Furthermore, the spherical transform is not resolution-dependent and achieve same results on different input resolution.      
### 24.Alpha Net: Adaptation with Composition in Classifier Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07073.pdf)
>  Deep learning classification models typically train poorly on classes with small numbers of examples. Motivated by the human ability to solve this task, models have been developed that transfer knowledge from classes with many examples to learn classes with few examples. Critically, the majority of these models transfer knowledge within model feature space. In this work, we demonstrate that transferring knowledge within classified space is more effective and efficient. Specifically, by linearly combining strong nearest neighbor classifiers along with a weak classifier, we are able to compose a stronger classifier. Uniquely, our model can be implemented on top of any existing classification model that includes a classifier layer. We showcase the success of our approach in the task of long-tailed recognition, whereby the classes with few examples, otherwise known as the "tail" classes, suffer the most in performance and are the most challenging classes to learn. Using classifier-level knowledge transfer, we are able to drastically improve - by a margin as high as 12.6% - the state-of-the-art performance on the "tail" categories.      
### 25.Progressively Guided Alternate Refinement Network for RGB-D Salient Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07064.pdf)
>  In this paper, we aim to develop an efficient and compact deep network for RGB-D salient object detection, where the depth image provides complementary information to boost performance in complex scenarios. Starting from a coarse initial prediction by a multi-scale residual block, we propose a progressively guided alternate refinement network to refine it. Instead of using ImageNet pre-trained backbone network, we first construct a lightweight depth stream by learning from scratch, which can extract complementary features more efficiently with less redundancy. Then, different from the existing fusion based methods, RGB and depth features are fed into proposed guided residual (GR) blocks alternately to reduce their mutual degradation. By assigning progressive guidance in the stacked GR blocks within each side-output, the false detection and missing parts can be well remedied. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, and also shows superiority in efficiency (71 FPS) and model size (64.9 MB).      
### 26.Video Region Annotation with Sparse Bounding Boxes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07049.pdf)
>  Video analysis has been moving towards more detailed interpretation (e.g. segmentation) with encouraging progresses. These tasks, however, increasingly rely on densely annotated training data both in space and time. Since such annotation is labour-intensive, few densely annotated video data with detailed region boundaries exist. This work aims to resolve this dilemma by learning to automatically generate region boundaries for all frames of a video from sparsely annotated bounding boxes of target regions. We achieve this with a Volumetric Graph Convolutional Network (VGCN), which learns to iteratively find keypoints on the region boundaries using the spatio-temporal volume of surrounding appearance and motion. The global optimization of VGCN makes it significantly stronger and generalize better than existing solutions. Experimental results using two latest datasets (one real and one synthetic), including ablation studies, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.      
### 27.Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images with Box Boundary-Aware Vectors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07043.pdf)
>  Oriented object detection in aerial images is a challenging task as the objects in aerial images are displayed in arbitrary directions and are usually densely packed. Current oriented object detection methods mainly rely on two-stage anchor-based detectors. However, the anchor-based detectors typically suffer from a severe imbalance issue between the positive and negative anchor boxes. To address this issue, in this work we extend the horizontal keypoint-based object detector to the oriented object detection task. In particular, we first detect the center keypoints of the objects, based on which we then regress the box boundary-aware vectors (BBAVectors) to capture the oriented bounding boxes. The box boundary-aware vectors are distributed in the four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system for all arbitrarily oriented objects. To relieve the difficulty of learning the vectors in the corner cases, we further classify the oriented bounding boxes into horizontal and rotational bounding boxes. In the experiment, we show that learning the box boundary-aware vectors is superior to directly predicting the width, height, and angle of an oriented bounding box, as adopted in the baseline method. Besides, the proposed method competes favorably with state-of-the-art methods.

### 28.AutoPose: Searching Multi-Scale Branch Aggregation for Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07018.pdf)
>  We present AutoPose, a novel neural architecture search(NAS) framework that is capable of automatically discovering multiple parallel branches of cross-scale connections towards accurate and high-resolution 2D human pose estimation. Recently, high-performance hand-crafted convolutional networks for pose estimation show growing demands on multi-scale fusion and high-resolution representations. However, current NAS works exhibit limited flexibility on scale searching, they dominantly adopt simplified search spaces of single-branch architectures. Such simplification limits the fusion of information at different scales and fails to maintain high-resolution representations. The presentedAutoPose framework is able to search for multi-branch scales and network depth, in addition to the cell-level microstructure. Motivated by the search space, a novel bi-level optimization method is presented, where the network-level architecture is searched via reinforcement learning, and the cell-level search is conducted by the gradient-based method. Within 2.5 GPU days, AutoPose is able to find very competitive architectures on the MS COCO dataset, that are also transferable to the MPII dataset.

### 29.Adversarial Concurrent Training: Optimizing Robustness and Accuracy Trade-off of Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07015.pdf)
>  Adversarial training has been proven to be an effective technique for improving the adversarial robustness of models. However, there seems to be an inherent trade-off between optimizing the model for accuracy and robustness. To this end, we propose Adversarial Concurrent Training (ACT), which employs adversarial training in a collaborative learning framework whereby we train a robust model in conjunction with a natural model in a minimax game. ACT encourages the two models to align their feature space by using the task-specific decision boundaries and explore the input space more broadly. Furthermore, the natural model acts as a regularizer, enforcing priors on features that the robust model should learn. Our analyses on the behavior of the models show that ACT leads to a robust model with lower model complexity, higher information compression in the learned representations, and high posterior entropy solutions indicative of convergence to a flatter minima. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across different datasets and network architectures. On ImageNet, ACT achieves 68.20% standard accuracy and 44.29% robustness accuracy under a 100-iteration untargeted attack, improving upon the standard adversarial training method's 65.70% standard accuracy and 42.36% robustness.      
### 30.Time-Supervised Primary Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07012.pdf)
>  We describe an unsupervised method to detect and segment portions of live scenes that, at some point in time, are seen moving as a coherent whole, which we refer to as primary objects. Our method first segments motions by minimizing the mutual information between partitions of the image domain, which bootstraps a static object detection model that takes a single image as input. The two models are mutually reinforced within a feedback loop, enabling extrapolation to previously unseen classes of objects. Our method requires video for training, but can be used on either static images or videos at inference time. As the volume of our training sets grows, more and more objects are seen moving, thus turning our method into unsupervised (or time-supervised) training to segment primary objects. The resulting system outperforms the state-of-the-art in both video object segmentation and salient object detection benchmarks, even when compared to methods that use explicit manual annotation.      
### 31.InstanceMotSeg: Real-time Instance Motion Segmentation for Autonomous Driving  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07008.pdf)
>  Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for autonomous vehicles as it can be used to segment objects in a class agnostic manner based on its motion cues. It will enable the detection of objects unseen during training (e.g., moose or a construction truck) generically based on their motion. Although pixel-wise motion segmentation has been studied in the literature, it is not dealt with at instance level, which would help separate connected segments of moving objects leading to better trajectory planning. In this paper, we proposed a motion-based instance segmentation task and created a new annotated dataset based on KITTI, which will be released publicly. We make use of the YOLACT model to solve the instance motion segmentation network by feeding inflow and image as input and instance motion masks as output. We extend it to a multi-task model that learns semantic and motion instance segmentation in a computationally efficient manner. Our model is based on sharing a prototype generation network between the two tasks and learning separate prototype coefficients per task. To obtain real-time performance, we study different efficient encoders and obtain 39 fps on a Titan Xp GPU using MobileNetV2 with an improvement of 10% mAP relative to the baseline.

### 32.Learning Disentangled Expression Representations from Facial Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07001.pdf)
>  Face images are subject to many different factors of variation, especially in unconstrained in-the-wild scenarios. For most tasks involving such images, e.g. expression recognition from video streams, having enough labeled data is prohibitively expensive. One common strategy to tackle such a problem is to learn disentangled representations for the different factors of variation of the observed data using adversarial learning. In this paper, we use a formulation of the adversarial loss to learn disentangled representations for face images. The used model facilitates learning on single-task datasets and improves the state-of-the-art in expression recognition with an accuracy of60.53%on the AffectNetdataset, without using any additional data.      
### 33.Is Face Recognition Sexist? No, Gendered Hairstyles and Biology Are  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06989.pdf)
>  Recent news articles have accused face recognition of being "biased", "sexist" or "racist". There is consensus in the research literature that face recognition accuracy is lower for females, who often have both a higher false match rate and a higher false non-match rate. However, there is little published research aimed at identifying the cause of lower accuracy for females. For instance, the 2019 Face Recognition Vendor Test that documents lower female accuracy across a broad range of algorithms and datasets also lists "Analyze cause and effect" under the heading "What we did not do". We present the first experimental analysis to identify major causes of lower face recognition accuracy for females on datasets where previous research has observed this result. Controlling for equal amount of visible face in the test images reverses the apparent higher false non-match rate for females. Also, principal component analysis indicates that images of two different females are inherently more similar than of two different males, potentially accounting for a difference in false match rates.      
### 34.False Detection (Positives and Negatives) in Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06986.pdf)
>  Object detection is a very important function of visual perception systems. Since the early days of classical object detection based on HOG to modern deep learning based detectors, object detection has improved in accuracy. Two stage detectors usually have higher accuracy than single stage ones. Both types of detectors use some form of quantization of the search space of rectangular regions of image. There are far more of the quantized elements than true objects. The way these bounding boxes are filtered out possibly results in the false positive and false negatives. This empirical experimental study explores ways of reducing false positives and negatives with labelled data.. In the process also discovered insufficient labelling in Openimage 2019 Object Detection dataset.      
### 35.A Self-supervised GAN for Unsupervised Few-shot Object Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06982.pdf)
>  This paper addresses unsupervised few-shot object recognition, where all training images are unlabeled, and test images are divided into queries and a few labeled support images per object class of interest. The training and test images do not share object classes. We extend the vanilla GAN with two loss functions, both aimed at self-supervised learning. The first is a reconstruction loss that enforces the discriminator to reconstruct the probabilistically sampled latent code which has been used for generating the ``fake'' image. The second is a triplet loss that enforces the discriminator to output image encodings that are closer for more similar images. Evaluation, comparisons, and detailed ablation studies are done in the context of few-shot classification. Our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the Mini-Imagenet and Tiered-Imagenet datasets.      
### 36.Bowtie Networks: Generative Modeling for Joint Few-Shot Recognition and Novel-View Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06981.pdf)
>  Generative modeling has recently shown great promise in computer vision, but its success is often limited to separate tasks. In this paper, motivated by multi-task learning of shareable feature representations, we consider a novel problem of learning a shared generative model across various tasks. We instantiate it on the illustrative dual-task of joint few-shot recognition and novel-view synthesis: given only one or few images of a novel object from arbitrary views with only category annotation, we aim to simultaneously learn an object classifier and generate images of the object from new viewpoints. To this end, we propose bowtie networks that jointly learn 3D geometric and semantic representations with feedback in the loop. Experimental evaluation on challenging fine-grained recognition datasets demonstrates that our synthesized images are realistic from multiple viewpoints and significantly improve recognition performance as ways of data augmentation, especially in the low-data regime. We further show that our approach is flexible and can be easily extended to incorporate other tasks, such as style guided synthesis.      
### 37.Mesorasi: Architecture Support for Point Cloud Analytics via Delayed-Aggregation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06967.pdf)
>  Point cloud analytics is poised to become a key workload on battery-powered embedded and mobile platforms in a wide range of emerging application domains, such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality, where efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes Mesorasi, an algorithm-architecture co-designed system that simultaneously improves the performance and energy efficiency of point cloud analytics while retaining its accuracy. Our extensive characterizations of state-of-the-art point cloud algorithms show that, while structurally reminiscent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), point cloud algorithms exhibit inherent compute and memory inefficiencies due to the unique characteristics of point cloud data. We propose delayed-aggregation, a new algorithmic primitive for building efficient point cloud algorithms. Delayed-aggregation hides the performance bottlenecks and reduces the compute and memory redundancies by exploiting the approximately distributive property of key operations in point cloud algorithms. Delayed-aggregation let point cloud algorithms achieve 1.6x speedup and 51.1% energy reduction on a mobile GPU while retaining the accuracy (-0.9% loss to 1.2% gains). To maximize the algorithmic benefits, we propose minor extensions to contemporary CNN accelerators, which can be integrated into a mobile Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC) without modifying other SoC components. With additional hardware support, Mesorasi achieves up to 3.6x speedup.      
### 38.Do Not Disturb Me: Person Re-identification Under the Interference of Other Pedestrians  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06963.pdf)
>  In the conventional person Re-ID setting, it is widely assumed that cropped person images are for each individual. However, in a crowded scene, off-shelf-detectors may generate bounding boxes involving multiple people, where the large proportion of background pedestrians or human occlusion exists. The representation extracted from such cropped images, which contain both the target and the interference pedestrians, might include distractive information. This will lead to wrong retrieval results. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel deep network termed Pedestrian-Interference Suppression Network (PISNet). PISNet leverages a Query-Guided Attention Block (QGAB) to enhance the feature of the target in the gallery, under the guidance of the query. Furthermore, the involving Guidance Reversed Attention Module and the Multi-Person Separation Loss promote QGAB to suppress the interference of other pedestrians. Our method is evaluated on two new pedestrian-interference datasets and the results show that the proposed method performs favorably against existing Re-ID methods.      
### 39.Image Stylization for Robust Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06959.pdf)
>  Local features that are robust to both viewpoint and appearance changes are crucial for many computer vision tasks. In this work we investigate if photorealistic image stylization improves robustness of local features to not only day-night, but also weather and season variations. We show that image stylization in addition to color augmentation is a powerful method of learning robust features. We evaluate learned features on visual localization benchmarks, outperforming state of the art baseline models despite training without ground-truth 3D correspondences using synthetic homographies only. <br>We use trained feature networks to compete in Long-Term Visual Localization and Map-based Localization for Autonomous Driving challenges achieving competitive scores.      
### 40.Object-Aware Multi-Branch Relation Networks for Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06941.pdf)
>  Spatio-temporal video grounding aims to retrieve the spatio-temporal tube of a queried object according to the given sentence. Currently, most existing grounding methods are restricted to well-aligned segment-sentence pairs. In this paper, we explore spatio-temporal video grounding on unaligned data and multi-form sentences. This challenging task requires to capture critical object relations to identify the queried target. However, existing approaches cannot distinguish notable objects and remain in ineffective relation modeling between unnecessary objects. Thus, we propose a novel object-aware multi-branch relation network for object-aware relation discovery. Concretely, we first devise multiple branches to develop object-aware region modeling, where each branch focuses on a crucial object mentioned in the sentence. We then propose multi-branch relation reasoning to capture critical object relationships between the main branch and auxiliary branches. Moreover, we apply a diversity loss to make each branch only pay attention to its corresponding object and boost multi-branch learning. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed method.      
### 41.Visual stream connectivity predicts assessments of image quality  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06939.pdf)
>  Some biological mechanisms of early vision are comparatively well understood, but they have yet to be evaluated for their ability to accurately predict and explain human judgments of image similarity. From well-studied simple connectivity patterns in early vision, we derive a novel formalization of the psychophysics of similarity, showing the differential geometry that provides accurate and explanatory accounts of perceptual similarity judgments. These predictions then are further improved via simple regression on human behavioral reports, which in turn are used to construct more elaborate hypothesized neural connectivity patterns. Both approaches outperform standard successful measures of perceived image fidelity from the literature, as well as providing explanatory principles of similarity perception.      
### 42.Neural Descent for Visual 3D Human Pose and Shape  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06910.pdf)
>  We present deep neural network methodology to reconstruct the 3d pose and shape of people, given an input RGB image. We rely on a recently introduced, expressivefull body statistical 3d human model, GHUM, trained end-to-end, and learn to reconstruct its pose and shape state in a self-supervised regime. Central to our methodology, is a learning to learn and optimize approach, referred to as HUmanNeural Descent (HUND), which avoids both second-order differentiation when training the model parameters,and expensive state gradient descent in order to accurately minimize a semantic differentiable rendering loss at test time. Instead, we rely on novel recurrent stages to update the pose and shape parameters such that not only losses are minimized effectively, but the process is meta-regularized in order to ensure end-progress. HUND's symmetry between training and testing makes it the first 3d human sensing architecture to natively support different operating regimes including self-supervised ones. In diverse tests, we show that HUND achieves very competitive results in datasets like H3.6M and 3DPW, aswell as good quality 3d reconstructions for complex imagery collected in-the-wild.      
### 43.Geodesic Paths for Image Segmentation with Implicit Region-based Homogeneity Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06909.pdf)
>  Minimal paths are considered as a powerful and efficient tool for boundary detection and image segmentation due to its global optimality and well-established numerical solutions such as fast marching algorithm. In this paper, we introduce a flexible interactive image segmentation model based on the minimal geodesic framework in conjunction with region-based homogeneity enhancement. A key ingredient in our model is the construction of Finsler geodesic metrics, which are capable of integrating anisotropic and asymmetric edge features, region-based homogeneity and/or curvature regularization. This is done by exploiting an implicit method to incorporate the region-based homogeneity information to the metrics used. Moreover, we also introduce a way to build objective simple closed contours, each of which is treated as the concatenation of two disjoint open paths. Experimental results prove that the proposed model indeed outperforms state-of-the-art minimal paths-based image segmentation approaches.      
### 44.Context-aware Feature Generation for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06893.pdf)
>  Existing semantic segmentation models heavily rely on dense pixel-wise annotations. To reduce the annotation pressure, we focus on a challenging task named zero-shot semantic segmentation, which aims to segment unseen objects with zero annotations. This task can be accomplished by transferring knowledge across categories via semantic word embeddings. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware feature generation method for zero-shot segmentation named CaGNet. In particular, with the observation that a pixel-wise feature highly depends on its contextual information, we insert a contextual module in a segmentation network to capture the pixel-wise contextual information, which guides the process of generating more diverse and context-aware features from semantic word embeddings. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets for zero-shot segmentation.

### 45.DeVLBert: Learning Deconfounded Visio-Linguistic Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06884.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose to investigate the problem of out-of-domain visio-linguistic pretraining, where the pretraining data distribution differs from that of downstream data on which the pretrained model will be fine-tuned. Existing methods for this problem are purely likelihood-based, leading to the spurious correlations and hurt the generalization ability when transferred to out-of-domain downstream tasks. By spurious correlation, we mean that the conditional probability of one token (object or word) given another one can be high (due to the dataset biases) without robust (causal) relationships between them. To mitigate such dataset biases, we propose a Deconfounded Visio-Linguistic Bert framework, abbreviated as DeVLBert, to perform intervention-based learning. We borrow the idea of the backdoor adjustment from the research field of causality and propose several neural-network based architectures for Bert-style out-of-domain pretraining. The quantitative results on three downstream tasks, Image Retrieval (IR), Zero-shot IR, and Visual Question Answering, show the effectiveness of DeVLBert by boosting generalization ability.      
### 46.SPL-MLL: Selecting Predictable Landmarks for Multi-Label Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06883.pdf)
>  Although significant progress achieved, multi-label classification is still challenging due to the complexity of correlations among different labels. Furthermore, modeling the relationships between input and some (dull) classes further increases the difficulty of accurately predicting all possible labels. In this work, we propose to select a small subset of labels as landmarks which are easy to predict according to input (predictable) and can well recover the other possible labels (representative). Different from existing methods which separate the landmark selection and landmark prediction in the 2-step manner, the proposed algorithm, termed Selecting Predictable Landmarks for Multi-Label Learning (SPL-MLL), jointly conducts landmark selection, landmark prediction, and label recovery in a unified framework, to ensure both the representativeness and predictableness for selected landmarks. We employ the Alternating Direction Method (ADM) to solve our problem. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification performance over other state-of-the-art methods.      
### 47.Poet: Product-oriented Video Captioner for E-commerce  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06880.pdf)
>  In e-commerce, a growing number of user-generated videos are used for product promotion. How to generate video descriptions that narrate the user-preferred product characteristics depicted in the video is vital for successful promoting. Traditional video captioning methods, which focus on routinely describing what exists and happens in a video, are not amenable for product-oriented video captioning. To address this problem, we propose a product-oriented video captioner framework, abbreviated as Poet. Poet firstly represents the videos as product-oriented spatial-temporal graphs. Then, based on the aspects of the video-associated product, we perform knowledge-enhanced spatial-temporal inference on those graphs for capturing the dynamic change of fine-grained product-part characteristics. The knowledge leveraging module in Poet differs from the traditional design by performing knowledge filtering and dynamic memory modeling. We show that Poet achieves consistent performance improvement over previous methods concerning generation quality, product aspects capturing, and lexical diversity. Experiments are performed on two product-oriented video captioning datasets, buyer-generated fashion video dataset (BFVD) and fan-generated fashion video dataset (FFVD), collected from Mobile Taobao. We will release the desensitized datasets to promote further investigations on both video captioning and general video analysis problems.      
### 48.SMPLpix: Neural Avatars from 3D Human Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06872.pdf)
>  Recent advances in deep generative models have led to an unprecedented level of realism for synthetically generated images of humans. However, one of the remaining fundamental limitations of these models is the ability to flexibly control the generative process, e.g. change the camera and human pose while retaining the subject identity. At the same time, deformable human body models like SMPL and its successors provide full control over pose and shape, but rely on classic computer graphics pipelines for rendering. Such rendering pipelines require explicit mesh rasterization that (a) does not have the potential to fix artifacts or lack of realism in the original 3D geometry and (b) until recently, were not fully incorporated into deep learning frameworks. In this work, we propose to bridge the gap between classic geometry-based rendering and the latest generative networks operating in pixel space by introducing a neural rasterizer, a trainable neural network module that directly "renders" a sparse set of 3D mesh vertices as photorealistic images, avoiding any hardwired logic in pixel colouring and occlusion reasoning. We train our model on a large corpus of human 3D models and corresponding real photos, and show the advantage over conventional differentiable renderers both in terms of the level of photorealism and rendering efficiency.      
### 49.KutralNet: A Portable Deep Learning Model for Fire Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06866.pdf)
>  Most of the automatic fire alarm systems detect the fire presence through sensors like thermal, smoke, or flame. One of the new approaches to the problem is the use of images to perform the detection. The image approach is promising since it does not need specific sensors and can be easily embedded in different devices. However, besides the high performance, the computational cost of the used deep learning methods is a challenge to their deployment in portable devices. In this work, we propose a new deep learning architecture that requires fewer floating-point operations (flops) for fire recognition. Additionally, we propose a portable approach for fire recognition and the use of modern techniques such as inverted residual block, convolutions like depth-wise, and octave, to reduce the model's computational cost. The experiments show that our model keeps high accuracy while substantially reducing the number of parameters and flops. One of our models presents 71\% fewer parameters than FireNet, while still presenting competitive accuracy and AUROC performance. The proposed methods are evaluated on FireNet and FiSmo datasets. The obtained results are promising for the implementation of the model in a mobile device, considering the reduced number of flops and parameters acquired.      
### 50.Detection of Gait Abnormalities caused by Neurological Disorders  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06861.pdf)
>  In this paper, we leverage gait to potentially detect some of the important neurological disorders, namely Parkinson's disease, Diplegia, Hemiplegia, and Huntington's Chorea. Persons with these neurological disorders often have a very abnormal gait, which motivates us to target gait for their potential detection. Some of the abnormalities involve the circumduction of legs, forward-bending, involuntary movements, etc. To detect such abnormalities in gait, we develop gait features from the key-points of the human pose, namely shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, ankles, etc. To evaluate the effectiveness of our gait features in detecting the abnormalities related to these diseases, we build a synthetic video dataset of persons mimicking the gait of persons with such disorders, considering the difficulty in finding a sufficient number of people with these disorders. We name it \textit{NeuroSynGait} video dataset. Experiments demonstrated that our gait features were indeed successful in detecting these abnormalities.      
### 51.Learning Flow-based Feature Warping for Face Frontalization with Illumination Inconsistent Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06843.pdf)
>  Despite recent advances in deep learning-based face frontalization methods, photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal face synthesis is still challenging due to large pose and illumination discrepancy during training. We propose a novel Flow-based Feature Warping Model (FFWM) which can learn to synthesize photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images with illumination inconsistent supervision. Specifically, an Illumination Preserving Module (IPM) is proposed to learn illumination preserving image synthesis from illumination inconsistent image pairs. IPM includes two pathways which collaborate to ensure the synthesized frontal images are illumination preserving and with fine details. Moreover, a Warp Attention Module (WAM) is introduced to reduce the pose discrepancy in the feature level, and hence to synthesize frontal images more effectively and preserve more details of profile images. The attention mechanism in WAM helps reduce the artifacts caused by the displacements between the profile and the frontal images. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our FFWM can synthesize photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images and performs favorably against the state-of-the-art results.      
### 52.We Learn Better Road Pothole Detection: from Attention Aggregation to Adversarial Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06840.pdf)
>  Manual visual inspection performed by certified inspectors is still the main form of road pothole detection. This process is, however, not only tedious, time-consuming and costly, but also dangerous for the inspectors. Furthermore, the road pothole detection results are always subjective, because they depend entirely on the individual experience. Our recently introduced disparity (or inverse depth) transformation algorithm allows better discrimination between damaged and undamaged road areas, and it can be easily deployed to any semantic segmentation network for better road pothole detection results. To boost the performance, we propose a novel attention aggregation (AA) framework, which takes the advantages of different types of attention modules. In addition, we develop an effective training set augmentation technique based on adversarial domain adaptation, where the synthetic road RGB images and transformed road disparity (or inverse depth) images are generated to enhance the training of semantic segmentation networks. The experimental results demonstrate that, firstly, the transformed disparity (or inverse depth) images become more informative; secondly, AA-UNet and AA-RTFNet, our best performing implementations, respectively outperform all other state-of-the-art single-modal and data-fusion networks for road pothole detection; and finally, the training set augmentation technique based on adversarial domain adaptation not only improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, but also accelerates their convergence.      
### 53.Open source tools for management and archiving of digital microscopy data to allow integration with patient pathology and treatment information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06837.pdf)
>  Virtual microscopy includes digitisation of histology slides and the use of computer technologies for complex investigation of diseases such as cancer. However, automated image analysis, or website publishing of such digital images, is hampered by their large file sizes. We have developed two Java based open source tools: Snapshot Creator and NDPI-Splitter. Snapshot Creator converts a portion of a large digital slide into a desired quality JPEG image. The image is linked to the patients clinical and treatment information in a customised open source cancer data management software (Caisis) in use at the Australian Breast Cancer Tissue Bank (ABCTB) and then published on the ABCTB website <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://www.abctb.org.au" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> using Deep Zoom open source technology. Using the ABCTB online search engine, digital images can be searched by defining various criteria such as cancer type, or biomarkers expressed. NDPI-Splitter splits a large image file into smaller sections of TIFF images so that they can be easily analysed by image analysis software such as Metamorph or Matlab. NDPI-Splitter also has the capacity to filter out empty images. Snapshot Creator and NDPI-Splitter are novel open source Java tools. They convert digital slides into files of smaller size for further processing. In conjunction with other open source tools such as Deep Zoom and Caisis, this suite of tools is used for the management and archiving of digital microscopy images, enabling digitised images to be explored and zoomed online. Our online image repository also has the capacity to be used as a teaching resource. These tools also enable large files to be sectioned for image analysis.      
### 54.A novel approach to remove foreign objects from chest X-ray images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06828.pdf)
>  We initially proposed a deep learning approach for foreign objects inpainting in smartphone-camera captured chest radiographs utilizing the cheXphoto dataset. Foreign objects which can significantly affect the quality of a computer-aided diagnostic prediction are captured under various settings. In this paper, we used multi-method to tackle both removal and inpainting chest radiographs. Firstly, an object detection model is trained to separate the foreign objects from the given image. Subsequently, the binary mask of each object is extracted utilizing a segmentation model. Each pair of the binary mask and the extracted object are then used for inpainting purposes. Finally, the in-painted regions are now merged back to the original image, resulting in a clean and non-foreign-object-existing output. To conclude, we achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. The experimental results showed a new approach to the possible applications of this method for chest X-ray images detection.      
### 55.Faster Person Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06826.pdf)
>  Fast person re-identification (ReID) aims to search person images quickly and accurately. The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm, which learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and counting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g. 2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new solution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code search strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving both faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank broad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top candidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an All-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization (DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of different lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid structure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by self-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple optimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily controlled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a $F_{\beta}$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution functions. Experimental results on 2 datasets show that our proposed method (CtF) is not only 8% more accurate but also 5x faster than contemporary hashing ReID methods. Compared with non-hashing ReID methods, CtF is $50\times$ faster with comparable accuracy.

### 56.Attack on Multi-Node Attention for Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06822.pdf)
>  This paper focuses on high-transferable adversarial attacks on detection networks, which are crucial for life-concerning systems such as autonomous driving and security surveillance. Detection networks are hard to attack in a black-box manner, because of their multiple-output property and diversity across architectures. To pursue a high attacking transferability, one needs to find a common property shared by different models. Multi-node attention heat map obtained by our newly proposed method is such a property. Based on it, we design the ATTACk on multi-node attenTION for object detecTION (ATTACTION). ATTACTION achieves a state-of-the-art transferability in numerical experiments. On MS COCO, the detection mAP for all 7 tested black-box architectures is halved and the performance of semantic segmentation is greatly influenced. Given the great transferability of ATTACTION, we generate Adversarial Objects in COntext (AOCO), the first adversarial dataset on object detection networks, which could help designers to quickly evaluate and improve the robustness of detection networks.      
### 57.Cascaded channel pruning using hierarchical self-distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06814.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose an approach for filter-level pruning with hierarchical knowledge distillation based on the teacher, teaching-assistant, and student framework. Our method makes use of teaching assistants at intermediate pruning levels that share the same architecture and weights as the target student. We propose to prune each model independently using the gradient information from its corresponding teacher. By considering the relative sizes of each student-teacher pair, this formulation provides a natural trade-off between the capacity gap for knowledge distillation and the bias of the filter saliency updates. Our results show improvements in the attainable accuracy and model compression across the CIFAR10 and ImageNet classification tasks using the VGG16and ResNet50 architectures. We provide an extensive evaluation that demonstrates the benefits of using a varying number of teaching assistant models at different sizes.      
### 58.Cluster-level Feature Alignment for Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06810.pdf)
>  Instance-level alignment is widely exploited for person re-identification, e.g. spatial alignment, latent semantic alignment and triplet alignment. This paper probes another feature alignment modality, namely cluster-level feature alignment across whole dataset, where the model can see not only the sampled images in local mini-batch but the global feature distribution of the whole dataset from distilled anchors. Towards this aim, we propose anchor loss and investigate many variants of cluster-level feature alignment, which consists of iterative aggregation and alignment from the overview of dataset. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that our methods can provide consistent and significant performance improvement with small training efforts after the saturation of traditional training. In both theoretical and experimental aspects, our proposed methods can result in more stable and guided optimization towards better representation and generalization for well-aligned embedding.      
### 59.A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for the Detection of Polyps in Colonoscopy Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06721.pdf)
>  Computerized detection of colonic polyps remains an unsolved issue because of the wide variation in the appearance, texture, color, size, and presence of the multiple polyp-like imitators during colonoscopy. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional neural network based model for the computerized detection of polyps within colonoscopy images. The proposed model comprises 16 convolutional layers with 2 fully connected layers, and a Softmax layer, where we implement a unique approach using different convolutional kernels within the same hidden layer for deeper feature extraction. We applied two different activation functions, MISH and rectified linear unit activation functions for deeper propagation of information and self regularized smooth non-monotonicity. Furthermore, we used a generalized intersection of union, thus overcoming issues such as scale invariance, rotation, and shape. Data augmentation techniques such as photometric and geometric distortions are adapted to overcome the obstacles faced in polyp detection. Detailed benchmarked results are provided, showing better performance in terms of precision, sensitivity, F1- score, F2- score, and dice-coefficient, thus proving the efficacy of the proposed model.      
### 60.Curriculum Learning for Recurrent Video Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06698.pdf)
>  Video object segmentation can be understood as a sequence-to-sequence task that can benefit from the curriculum learning strategies for better and faster training of deep neural networks. This work explores different schedule sampling and frame skipping variations to significantly improve the performance of a recurrent architecture. Our results on the car class of the KITTI-MOTS challenge indicate that, surprisingly, an inverse schedule sampling is a better option than a classic forward one. Also, that a progressive skipping of frames during training is beneficial, but only when training with the ground truth masks instead of the predicted ones.

### 61.BroadFace: Looking at Tens of Thousands of People at Once for Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06674.pdf)
>  The datasets of face recognition contain an enormous number of identities and instances. However, conventional methods have difficulty in reflecting the entire distribution of the datasets because a mini-batch of small size contains only a small portion of all identities. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel method called BroadFace, which is a learning process to consider a massive set of identities, comprehensively. In BroadFace, a linear classifier learns optimal decision boundaries among identities from a large number of embedding vectors accumulated over past iterations. By referring more instances at once, the optimality of the classifier is naturally increased on the entire datasets. Thus, the encoder is also globally optimized by referring the weight matrix of the classifier. Moreover, we propose a novel compensation method to increase the number of referenced instances in the training stage. BroadFace can be easily applied on many existing methods to accelerate a learning process and obtain a significant improvement in accuracy without extra computational burden at inference stage. We perform extensive ablation studies and experiments on various datasets to show the effectiveness of BroadFace, and also empirically prove the validity of our compensation method. BroadFace achieves the state-of-the-art results with significant improvements on nine datasets in 1:1 face verification and 1:N face identification tasks, and is also effective in image retrieval.      
### 62.ECG beats classification via online sparse dictionary and time pyramid matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06672.pdf)
>  Recently, the Bag-Of-Word (BOW) algorithm provides efficient features and promotes the accuracy of the ECG classification system. However, BOW algorithm has two shortcomings: (1). it has large quantization errors and poor reconstruction performance; (2). it loses heart beat's time information, and may provide confusing features for different kinds of heart beats. Furthermore, ECG classification system can be used for long time monitoring and analysis of cardiovascular patients, while a huge amount of data will be produced, so we urgently need an efficient compression algorithm. In view of the above problems, we use the wavelet feature to construct the sparse dictionary, which lower the quantization error to a minimum. In order to reduce the complexity of our algorithm and adapt to large-scale heart beats operation, we combine the Online Dictionary Learning with Feature-sign algorithm to update the dictionary and coefficients. Coefficients matrix is used to represent ECG beats, which greatly reduces the memory consumption, and solve the problem of quantitative error simultaneously. Finally, we construct the pyramid to match coefficients of each ECG beat. Thus, we obtain the features that contain the beat time information by time stochastic pooling. It is efficient to solve the problem of losing time information. The experimental results show that: on the one hand, the proposed algorithm has advantages of high reconstruction performance for BOW, this storage method is high fidelity and low memory consumption; on the other hand, our algorithm yields highest accuracy in ECG beats classification; so this method is more suitable for large-scale heart beats data storage and classification.      
### 63.Object Detection in the Context of Mobile Augmented Reality  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06655.pdf)
>  In the past few years, numerous Deep Neural Network (DNN) models and frameworks have been developed to tackle the problem of real-time object detection from RGB images. Ordinary object detection approaches process information from the images only, and they are oblivious to the camera pose with regard to the environment and the scale of the environment. On the other hand, mobile Augmented Reality (AR) frameworks can continuously track a camera's pose within the scene and can estimate the correct scale of the environment by using Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines the geometric information from VIO with semantic information from object detectors to improve the performance of object detection on mobile devices. Our approach includes three components: (1) an image orientation correction method, (2) a scale-based filtering approach, and (3) an online semantic map. Each component takes advantage of the different characteristics of the VIO-based AR framework. We implemented the AR-enhanced features using ARCore and the SSD Mobilenet model on Android phones. To validate our approach, we manually labeled objects in image sequences taken from 12 room-scale AR sessions. The results show that our approach can improve on the accuracy of generic object detectors by 12% on our dataset.      
### 64.Graph Edit Distance Reward: Learning to Edit Scene Graph  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06651.pdf)
>  Scene Graph, as a vital tool to bridge the gap between language domain and image domain, has been widely adopted in the cross-modality task like VQA. In this paper, we propose a new method to edit the scene graph according to the user instructions, which has never been explored. To be specific, in order to learn editing scene graphs as the semantics given by texts, we propose a Graph Edit Distance Reward, which is based on the Policy Gradient and Graph Matching algorithm, to optimize neural symbolic model. In the context of text-editing image retrieval, we validate the effectiveness of our method in CSS and CRIR dataset. Besides, CRIR is a new synthetic dataset generated by us, which we will publish it soon for future use.      
### 65.Neural Ray Surfaces for Self-Supervised Learning of Depth and Ego-motion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06630.pdf)
>  Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool for depth and ego-motion estimation, leading to state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. However, one significant limitation shared by current methods is the assumption of a known parametric camera model -- usually the standard pinhole geometry -- leading to failure when applied to imaging systems that deviate significantly from this assumption (e.g., catadioptric cameras or underwater imaging). In this work, we show that self-supervision can be used to learn accurate depth and ego-motion estimation without prior knowledge of the camera model. Inspired by the geometric model of Grossberg and Nayar, we introduce Neural Ray Surfaces (NRS), convolutional networks that represent pixel-wise projection rays, approximating a wide range of cameras. NRS are fully differentiable and can be learned end-to-end from unlabeled raw videos. We demonstrate the use of NRS for self-supervised learning of visual odometry and depth estimation from raw videos obtained using a wide variety of camera systems, including pinhole, fisheye, and catadioptric.      
### 66.Object Detection with a Unified Label Space from Multiple Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06614.pdf)
>  Given multiple datasets with different label spaces, the goal of this work is to train a single object detector predicting over the union of all the label spaces. The practical benefits of such an object detector are obvious and significant application-relevant categories can be picked and merged form arbitrary existing datasets. However, naive merging of datasets is not possible in this case, due to inconsistent object annotations. Consider an object category like faces that is annotated in one dataset, but is not annotated in another dataset, although the object itself appears in the latter images. Some categories, like face here, would thus be considered foreground in one dataset, but background in another. To address this challenge, we design a framework which works with such partial annotations, and we exploit a pseudo labeling approach that we adapt for our specific case. We propose loss functions that carefully integrate partial but correct annotations with complementary but noisy pseudo labels. Evaluation in the proposed novel setting requires full annotation on the test set. We collect the required annotations and define a new challenging experimental setup for this task based one existing public datasets. We show improved performances compared to competitive baselines and appropriate adaptations of existing work.      
### 67.Self-supervised Contrastive Video-Speech Representation Learning for Ultrasound  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06607.pdf)
>  In medical imaging, manual annotations can be expensive to acquire and sometimes infeasible to access, making conventional deep learning-based models difficult to scale. As a result, it would be beneficial if useful representations could be derived from raw data without the need for manual annotations. In this paper, we propose to address the problem of self-supervised representation learning with multi-modal ultrasound video-speech raw data. For this case, we assume that there is a high correlation between the ultrasound video and the corresponding narrative speech audio of the sonographer. In order to learn meaningful representations, the model needs to identify such correlation and at the same time understand the underlying anatomical features. We designed a framework to model the correspondence between video and audio without any kind of human annotations. Within this framework, we introduce cross-modal contrastive learning and an affinity-aware self-paced learning scheme to enhance correlation modelling. Experimental evaluations on multi-modal fetal ultrasound video and audio show that the proposed approach is able to learn strong representations and transfers well to downstream tasks of standard plane detection and eye-gaze prediction.      
### 68.Weakly supervised cross-domain alignment with optimal transport  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06597.pdf)
>  Cross-domain alignment between image objects and text sequences is key to many visual-language tasks, and it poses a fundamental challenge to both computer vision and natural language processing. This paper investigates a novel approach for the identification and optimization of fine-grained semantic similarities between image and text entities, under a weakly-supervised setup, improving performance over state-of-the-art solutions. Our method builds upon recent advances in optimal transport (OT) to resolve the cross-domain matching problem in a principled manner. Formulated as a drop-in regularizer, the proposed OT solution can be efficiently computed and used in combination with other existing approaches. We present empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing how it enables simpler model architectures to outperform or be comparable with more sophisticated designs on a range of vision-language tasks.      
### 69.Audio-Visual Event Localization via Recursive Fusion by Joint Co-Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06581.pdf)
>  The major challenge in audio-visual event localization task lies in how to fuse information from multiple modalities effectively. Recent works have shown that attention mechanism is beneficial to the fusion process. In this paper, we propose a novel joint attention mechanism with multimodal fusion methods for audio-visual event localization. Particularly, we present a concise yet valid architecture that effectively learns representations from multiple modalities in a joint manner. Initially, visual features are combined with auditory features and then turned into joint representations. Next, we make use of the joint representations to attend to visual features and auditory features, respectively. With the help of this joint co-attention, new visual and auditory features are produced, and thus both features can enjoy the mutually improved benefits from each other. It is worth noting that the joint co-attention unit is recursive meaning that it can be performed multiple times for obtaining better joint representations progressively. Extensive experiments on the public AVE dataset have shown that the proposed method achieves significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 70.Sketch-Guided Object Localization in Natural Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06551.pdf)
>  We introduce the novel problem of localizing all the instances of an object (seen or unseen during training) in a natural image via sketch query. We refer to this problem as sketch-guided object localization. This problem is distinctively different from the traditional sketch-based image retrieval task where the gallery set often contains images with only one object. The sketch-guided object localization proves to be more challenging when we consider the following: (i) the sketches used as queries are abstract representations with little information on the shape and salient attributes of the object, (ii) the sketches have significant variability as they are hand-drawn by a diverse set of untrained human subjects, and (iii) there exists a domain gap between sketch queries and target natural images as these are sampled from very different data distributions. To address the problem of sketch-guided object localization, we propose a novel cross-modal attention scheme that guides the region proposal network (RPN) to generate object proposals relevant to the sketch query. These object proposals are later scored against the query to obtain final localization. Our method is effective with as little as a single sketch query. Moreover, it also generalizes well to object categories not seen during training and is effective in localizing multiple object instances present in the image. Furthermore, we extend our framework to a multi-query setting using novel feature fusion and attention fusion strategies introduced in this paper. The localization performance is evaluated on publicly available object detection benchmarks, viz. MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC, with sketch queries obtained from `Quick, Draw!'. The proposed method significantly outperforms related baselines on both single-query and multi-query localization tasks.      
### 71.AntiDote: Attention-based Dynamic Optimization for Neural Network Runtime Efficiency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06543.pdf)
>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieved great cognitive performance at the expense of considerable computation load. To relieve the computation load, many optimization works are developed to reduce the model redundancy by identifying and removing insignificant model components, such as weight sparsity and filter pruning. However, these works only evaluate model components' static significance with internal parameter information, ignoring their dynamic interaction with external inputs. With per-input feature activation, the model component significance can dynamically change, and thus the static methods can only achieve sub-optimal results. Therefore, we propose a dynamic CNN optimization framework in this work. Based on the neural network attention mechanism, we propose a comprehensive dynamic optimization framework including (1) testing-phase channel and column feature map pruning, as well as (2) training-phase optimization by targeted dropout. Such a dynamic optimization framework has several benefits: (1) First, it can accurately identify and aggressively remove per-input feature redundancy with considering the model-input interaction; (2) Meanwhile, it can maximally remove the feature map redundancy in various dimensions thanks to the multi-dimension flexibility; (3) The training-testing co-optimization favors the dynamic pruning and helps maintain the model accuracy even with very high feature pruning ratio. Extensive experiments show that our method could bring 37.4% to 54.5% FLOPs reduction with negligible accuracy drop on various of test networks.      
### 72.MatryODShka: Real-time 6DoF Video View Synthesis using Multi-Sphere Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06534.pdf)
>  We introduce a method to convert stereo 360° (omnidirectional stereo) imagery into a layered, multi-sphere image representation for six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) rendering. Stereo 360° imagery can be captured from multi-camera systems for virtual reality (VR), but lacks motion parallax and correct-in-all-directions disparity cues. Together, these can quickly lead to VR sickness when viewing content. One solution is to try and generate a format suitable for 6DoF rendering, such as by estimating depth. However, this raises questions as to how to handle disoccluded regions in dynamic scenes. Our approach is to simultaneously learn depth and disocclusions via a multi-sphere image representation, which can be rendered with correct 6DoF disparity and motion parallax in VR. This significantly improves comfort for the viewer, and can be inferred and rendered in real time on modern GPU hardware. Together, these move towards making VR video a more comfortable immersive medium.      
### 73.Learning Gradient Fields for Shape Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06520.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose a novel technique to generate shapes from point cloud data. A point cloud can be viewed as samples from a distribution of 3D points whose density is concentrated near the surface of the shape. Point cloud generation thus amounts to moving randomly sampled points to high-density areas. We generate point clouds by performing stochastic gradient ascent on an unnormalized probability density, thereby moving sampled points toward the high-likelihood regions. Our model directly predicts the gradient of the log density field and can be trained with a simple objective adapted from score-based generative models. We show that our method can reach state-of-the-art performance for point cloud auto-encoding and generation, while also allowing for extraction of a high-quality implicit surface.

### 74.Siloed Federated Learning for Multi-Centric Histopathology Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07424.pdf)
>  While federated learning is a promising approach for training deep learning models over distributed sensitive datasets, it presents new challenges for machine learning, especially when applied in the medical domain where multi-centric data heterogeneity is common. Building on previous domain adaptation works, this paper proposes a novel federated learning approach for deep learning architectures via the introduction of local-statistic batch normalization (BN) layers, resulting in collaboratively-trained, yet center-specific models. This strategy improves robustness to data heterogeneity while also reducing the potential for information leaks by not sharing the center-specific layer activation statistics. We benchmark the proposed method on the classification of tumorous histopathology image patches extracted from the Camelyon16 and Camelyon17 datasets. We show that our approach compares favorably to previous state-of-the-art methods, especially for transfer learning across datasets.      
### 75.First U-Net Layers Contain More Domain Specific Information Than The Last Ones  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07357.pdf)
>  MRI scans appearance significantly depends on scanning protocols and, consequently, the data-collection institution. These variations between clinical sites result in dramatic drops of CNN segmentation quality on unseen domains. Many of the recently proposed MRI domain adaptation methods operate with the last CNN layers to suppress domain shift. At the same time, the core manifestation of MRI variability is a considerable diversity of image intensities. We hypothesize that these differences can be eliminated by modifying the first layers rather than the last ones. To validate this simple idea, we conducted a set of experiments with brain MRI scans from six domains. Our results demonstrate that 1) domain-shift may deteriorate the quality even for a simple brain extraction segmentation task (surface Dice Score drops from 0.85-0.89 even to 0.09); 2) fine-tuning of the first layers significantly outperforms fine-tuning of the last layers in almost all supervised domain adaptation setups. Moreover, fine-tuning of the first layers is a better strategy than fine-tuning of the whole network, if the amount of annotated data from the new domain is strictly limited.      
### 76.Bayesian deep learning: a new era for 'big data' geostatistics?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07320.pdf)
>  For geospatial modelling and mapping tasks, variants of kriging - the spatial interpolation technique developed by South African mining engineer Danie Krige - have long been regarded as the established geostatistical methods. However, kriging and its variants (such as regression kriging, in which auxiliary variables or derivatives of these are included as covariates) are relatively restrictive models and lack capabilities that have been afforded to us in the last decade by deep neural networks. Principal among these is feature learning - the ability to learn filters to recognise task-specific patterns in gridded data such as images. Here we demonstrate the power of feature learning in a geostatistical context, by showing how deep neural networks can automatically learn the complex relationships between point-sampled target variables and gridded auxiliary variables (such as those provided by remote sensing), and in doing so produce detailed maps of chosen target variables. At the same time, in order to cater for the needs of decision makers who require well-calibrated probabilities, we obtain uncertainty estimates via a Bayesian approximation known as Monte Carlo dropout. In our example, we produce a national-scale probabilistic geochemical map from point-sampled assay data, with auxiliary information provided by a terrain elevation grid. Unlike traditional geostatistical approaches, auxiliary variable grids are fed into our deep neural network raw. There is no need to provide terrain derivatives (e.g. slope angles, roughness, etc) because the deep neural network is capable of learning these and arbitrarily more complex derivatives as necessary to maximise predictive performance. We hope our results will raise awareness of the suitability of Bayesian deep learning - and its feature learning capabilities - for large-scale geostatistical applications where uncertainty matters.      
### 77.Facial Recognition: A cross-national Survey on Public Acceptance, Privacy, and Discrimination  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07275.pdf)
>  With rapid advances in machine learning (ML), more of this technology is being deployed into the real world interacting with us and our environment. One of the most widely applied application of ML is facial recognition as it is running on millions of devices. While being useful for some people, others perceive it as a threat when used by public authorities. This discrepancy and the lack of policy increases the uncertainty in the ML community about the future direction of facial recognition research and development. In this paper we present results from a cross-national survey about public acceptance, privacy, and discrimination of the use of facial recognition technology (FRT) in the public. This study provides insights about the opinion towards FRT from China, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US), which can serve as input for policy makers and legal regulators.      
### 78.MLBF-Net: A Multi-Lead-Branch Fusion Network for Multi-Class Arrhythmia Classification Using 12-Lead ECG  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07263.pdf)
>  Automatic arrhythmia detection using 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal plays a critical role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In the previous studies on automatic arrhythmia detection, most methods concatenated 12 leads of ECG into a matrix, and then input the matrix to a variety of feature extractors or deep neural networks for extracting useful information. Under such frameworks, these methods had the ability to extract comprehensive features (known as integrity) of 12-lead ECG since the information of each lead interacts with each other during training. However, the diverse lead-specific features (known as diversity) among 12 leads were neglected, causing inadequate information learning for 12-lead ECG. To maximize the information learning of multi-lead ECG, the information fusion of comprehensive features with integrity and lead-specific features with diversity should be taken into account. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Lead-Branch Fusion Network (MLBF-Net) architecture for arrhythmia classification by integrating multi-loss optimization to jointly learning diversity and integrity of multi-lead ECG. MLBF-Net is composed of three components: 1) multiple lead-specific branches for learning the diversity of multi-lead ECG; 2) cross-lead features fusion by concatenating the output feature maps of all branches for learning the integrity of multi-lead ECG; 3) multi-loss co-optimization for all the individual branches and the concatenated network. We demonstrate our MLBF-Net on China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 which is an open 12-lead ECG dataset. The experimental results show that MLBF-Net obtains an average $F_1$ score of 0.855, reaching the highest arrhythmia classification performance. The proposed method provides a promising solution for multi-lead ECG analysis from an information fusion perspective.      
### 79.Edge Network-Assisted Real-Time Object Detection Framework for Autonomous Driving  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07083.pdf)
>  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can achieve the desired results within a short duration by offloading tasks even requiring high computational power (e.g., object detection (OD)) to edge clouds. However, although edge clouds are exploited, real-time OD cannot always be guaranteed due to dynamic channel quality. To mitigate this problem, we propose an edge network-assisted real-time OD framework~(EODF). In an EODF, AVs extract the region of interests~(RoIs) of the captured image when the channel quality is not sufficiently good for supporting real-time OD. Then, AVs compress the image data on the basis of the RoIs and transmit the compressed one to the edge cloud. In so doing, real-time OD can be achieved owing to the reduced transmission latency. To verify the feasibility of our framework, we evaluate the probability that the results of OD are not received within the inter-frame duration (i.e., outage probability) and their accuracy. From the evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed EODF provides the results to AVs in real-time and achieves satisfactory accuracy.      
### 80.Towards Cardiac Intervention Assistance: Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Exploration for Real-Time 3D Cardiac Cine MRI Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07071.pdf)
>  Real-time cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in guiding various cardiac interventions. In order to provide better visual assistance, the cine MRI frames need to be segmented on-the-fly to avoid noticeable visual lag. In addition, considering reliability and patient data privacy, the computation is preferably done on local hardware. State-of-the-art MRI segmentation methods mostly focus on accuracy only, and can hardly be adopted for real-time application or on local hardware. In this work, we present the first hardware-aware multi-scale neural architecture search (NAS) framework for real-time 3D cardiac cine MRI segmentation. The proposed framework incorporates a latency regularization term into the loss function to handle real-time constraints, with the consideration of underlying hardware. In addition, the formulation is fully differentiable with respect to the architecture parameters, so that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be used for optimization to reduce the computation cost while maintaining optimization quality. Experimental results on ACDC MICCAI 2017 dataset demonstrate that our hardware-aware multi-scale NAS framework can reduce the latency by up to 3.5 times and satisfy the real-time constraints, while still achieving competitive segmentation accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art NAS segmentation framework.      
### 81.Training CNN Classifiers for Semantic Segmentation using Partially Annotated Images: with Application on Human Thigh and Calf MRI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07030.pdf)
>  Objective: Medical image datasets with pixel-level labels tend to have a limited number of organ or tissue label classes annotated, even when the images have wide anatomical coverage. With supervised learning, multiple classifiers are usually needed given these partially annotated datasets. In this work, we propose a set of strategies to train one single classifier in segmenting all label classes that are heterogeneously annotated across multiple datasets without moving into semi-supervised learning. Methods: Masks were first created from each label image through a process we termed presence masking. Three presence masking modes were evaluated, differing mainly in weightage assigned to the annotated and unannotated classes. These masks were then applied to the loss function during training to remove the influence of unannotated classes. Results: Evaluation against publicly available CT datasets shows that presence masking is a viable method for training class-generic classifiers. Our class-generic classifier can perform as well as multiple class-specific classifiers combined, while the training duration is similar to that required for one class-specific classifier. Furthermore, the class-generic classifier can outperform the class-specific classifiers when trained on smaller datasets. Finally, consistent results are observed from evaluations against human thigh and calf MRI datasets collected in-house. Conclusion: The evaluation outcomes show that presence masking is capable of significantly improving both training and inference efficiency across imaging modalities and anatomical regions. Improved performance may even be observed on small datasets. Significance: Presence masking strategies can reduce the computational resources and costs involved in manual medical image annotations.

### 82.Spontaneous preterm birth prediction using convolutional neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07000.pdf)
>  An estimated 15 million babies are born too early every year. Approximately 1 million children die each year due to complications of preterm birth (PTB). Many survivors face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems. Although manual analysis of ultrasound images (US) is still prevalent, it is prone to errors due to its subjective component and complex variations in the shape and position of organs across patients. In this work, we introduce a conceptually simple convolutional neural network (CNN) trained for segmenting prenatal ultrasound images and classifying task for the purpose of preterm birth detection. Our method efficiently segments different types of cervixes in transvaginal ultrasound images while simultaneously predicting a preterm birth based on extracted image features without human oversight. We employed three popular network models: U-Net, Fully Convolutional Network, and Deeplabv3 for the cervix segmentation task. Based on the conducted results and model efficiency, we decided to extend U-Net by adding a parallel branch for classification task. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on a dataset consisting of 354 2D transvaginal ultrasound images and achieved a segmentation accuracy with a mean Jaccard coefficient index of 0.923 $\pm$ 0.081 and a classification sensitivity of 0.677 $\pm$ 0.042 with a 3.49\% false positive rate. Our method obtained better results in the prediction of preterm birth based on transvaginal ultrasound images compared to state-of-the-art methods.      
### 83.RevPHiSeg: A Memory-Efficient Neural Network for Uncertainty Quantification in Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06999.pdf)
>  Quantifying segmentation uncertainty has become an important issue in medical image analysis due to the inherent ambiguity of anatomical structures and its pathologies. Recently, neural network-based uncertainty quantification methods have been successfully applied to various problems. One of the main limitations of the existing techniques is the high memory requirement during training; which limits their application to processing smaller field-of-views (FOVs) and/or using shallower architectures. In this paper, we investigate the effect of using reversible blocks for building memory-efficient neural network architectures for quantification of segmentation uncertainty. The reversible architecture achieves memory saving by exactly computing the activations from the outputs of the subsequent layers during backpropagation instead of storing the activations for each layer. We incorporate the reversible blocks into a recently proposed architecture called PHiSeg that is developed for uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation. The reversible architecture, RevPHiSeg, allows training neural networks for quantifying segmentation uncertainty on GPUs with limited memory and processing larger FOVs. We perform experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset and an in-house prostate dataset, and present comparisons with PHiSeg. The results demonstrate that RevPHiSeg consumes ~30% less memory compared to PHiSeg while achieving very similar segmentation accuracy.      
### 84.Deep Learning Predicts Cardiovascular Disease Risks from Lung Cancer Screening Low Dose Computed Tomography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06997.pdf)
>  The high risk population of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is simultaneously at high risk of lung cancer. Given the dominance of low dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening, the feasibility of extracting information on CVD from the same LDCT scan would add major value to patients at no additional radiation dose. However, with strong noise in LDCT images and without electrocardiogram (ECG) gating, CVD risk analysis from LDCT is highly challenging. Here we present an innovative deep learning model to address this challenge. Our deep model was trained with 30,286 LDCT volumes and achieved the state-of-the-art performance (area under the curve (AUC) of 0.869) on 2,085 National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) subjects, and effectively identified patients with high CVD mortality risks (AUC of 0.768). Our deep model was further calibrated against the clinical gold standard CVD risk scores from ECG-gated dedicated cardiac CT, including coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, CAD-RADS score and MESA 10-year CHD risk score from an independent dataset of 106 subjects. In this validation study, our model achieved AUC of 0.942, 0.809 and 0.817 for CAC, CAD-RADS and MESA scores, respectively. Our deep learning model has the potential to convert LDCT for lung cancer screening into dual-screening quantitative tool for CVD risk estimation.      
### 85.Prediction of Homicides in Urban Centers: A Machine Learning Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06979.pdf)
>  Relevant research has been standing out in the computing community aiming to develop computational models capable of predicting occurrence of crimes, analyzing contexts of crimes, extracting profiles of individuals linked to crimes, and analyzing crimes according to time. This, due to the social impact and also the complex origin of the data, thus showing itself as an interesting computational challenge. This research presents a computational model for the prediction of homicide crimes, based on tabular data of crimes registered in the city of Belém - Pará, Brazil. Statistical tests were performed with 8 different classification methods, both Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network presented best results, AUC ~ 0.8. Results considered as a baseline for the proposed problem.      
### 86.Automated Detection of Congenital Heart Disease in Fetal Ultrasound Screening  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06966.pdf)
>  Prenatal screening with ultrasound can lower neonatal mortality significantly for selected cardiac abnormalities. However, the need for human expertise, coupled with the high volume of screening cases, limits the practically achievable detection rates. In this paper we discuss the potential for deep learning techniques to aid in the detection of congenital heart disease (CHD) in fetal ultrasound. We propose a pipeline for automated data curation and classification. During both training and inference, we exploit an auxiliary view classification task to bias features toward relevant cardiac structures. This bias helps to improve in F1-scores from 0.72 and 0.77 to 0.87 and 0.85 for healthy and CHD classes respectively.      
### 87.Wavelet Denoising and Attention-based RNN-ARIMA Model to Predict Forex Price  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06841.pdf)
>  Every change of trend in the forex market presents a great opportunity as well as a risk for investors. Accurate forecasting of forex prices is a crucial element in any effective hedging or speculation strategy. However, the complex nature of the forex market makes the predicting problem challenging, which has prompted extensive research from various academic disciplines. In this paper, a novel approach that integrates the wavelet denoising, Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are proposed. Wavelet transform removes the noise from the time series to stabilize the data structure. ARNN model captures the robust and non-linear relationships in the sequence and ARIMA can well fit the linear correlation of the sequential information. By hybridization of the three models, the methodology is capable of modelling dynamic systems such as the forex market. Our experiments on USD/JPY five-minute data outperforms the baseline methods. Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) of the hybrid approach was found to be 1.65 with a directional accuracy of ~76%.      
### 88.Automated Detection of Cortical Lesions in Multiple Sclerosis Patients with 7T MRI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06780.pdf)
>  The automated detection of cortical lesions (CLs) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is a challenging task that, despite its clinical relevance, has received very little attention. Accurate detection of the small and scarce lesions requires specialized sequences and high or ultra-high field MRI. For supervised training based on multimodal structural MRI at 7T, two experts generated ground truth segmentation masks of 60 patients with 2014 CLs. We implemented a simplified 3D U-Net with three resolution levels (3D U-Net-). By increasing the complexity of the task (adding brain tissue segmentation), while randomly dropping input channels during training, we improved the performance compared to the baseline. Considering a minimum lesion size of 0.75 {\mu}L, we achieved a lesion-wise cortical lesion detection rate of 67% and a false positive rate of 42%. However, 393 (24%) of the lesions reported as false positives were post-hoc confirmed as potential or definite lesions by an expert. This indicates the potential of the proposed method to support experts in the tedious process of CL manual segmentation.      
### 89.Model Patching: Closing the Subgroup Performance Gap with Data Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06775.pdf)
>  Classifiers in machine learning are often brittle when deployed. Particularly concerning are models with inconsistent performance on specific subgroups of a class, e.g., exhibiting disparities in skin cancer classification in the presence or absence of a spurious bandage. To mitigate these performance differences, we introduce model patching, a two-stage framework for improving robustness that encourages the model to be invariant to subgroup differences, and focus on class information shared by subgroups. Model patching first models subgroup features within a class and learns semantic transformations between them, and then trains a classifier with data augmentations that deliberately manipulate subgroup features. We instantiate model patching with CAMEL, which (1) uses a CycleGAN to learn the intra-class, inter-subgroup augmentations, and (2) balances subgroup performance using a theoretically-motivated subgroup consistency regularizer, accompanied by a new robust objective. We demonstrate CAMEL's effectiveness on 3 benchmark datasets, with reductions in robust error of up to 33% relative to the best baseline. Lastly, CAMEL successfully patches a model that fails due to spurious features on a real-world skin cancer dataset.      
### 90.Single image dehazing for a variety of haze scenarios using back projected pyramid network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06713.pdf)
>  Learning to dehaze single hazy images, especially using a small training dataset is quite challenging. We propose a novel generative adversarial network architecture for this problem, namely back projected pyramid network (BPPNet), that gives good performance for a variety of challenging haze conditions, including dense haze and inhomogeneous haze. Our architecture incorporates learning of multiple levels of complexities while retaining spatial context through iterative blocks of UNets and structural information of multiple scales through a novel pyramidal convolution block. These blocks together for the generator and are amenable to learning through back projection. We have shown that our network can be trained without over-fitting using as few as 20 image pairs of hazy and non-hazy images. We report the state of the art performances on NTIRE 2018 homogeneous haze datasets for indoor and outdoor images, NTIRE 2019 denseHaze dataset, and NTIRE 2020 non-homogeneous haze dataset.      
### 91.Evolving Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Hyperspectral Image Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06634.pdf)
>  Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are susceptible to various noise factors leading to the loss of information, and the noise restricts the subsequent HSIs object detection and classification tasks. In recent years, learning-based methods have demonstrated their superior strengths in denoising the HSIs. Unfortunately, most of the methods are manually designed based on the extensive expertise that is not necessarily available to the users interested. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to automatically build an optimal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to effectively denoise HSIs. Particularly, the proposed algorithm focuses on the architectures and the initialization of the connection weights of the CNN. The experiments of the proposed algorithm have been well-designed and compared against the state-of-the-art peer competitors, and the experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the different evaluation metrics, visual assessments, and the computational complexity.      
### 92.Dehaze-GLCGAN: Unpaired Single Image De-hazing via Adversarial Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06632.pdf)
>  Single image de-hazing is a challenging problem, and it is far from solved. Most current solutions require paired image datasets that include both hazy images and their corresponding haze-free ground-truth images. However, in reality, lighting conditions and other factors can produce a range of haze-free images that can serve as ground truth for a hazy image, and a single ground truth image cannot capture that range. This limits the scalability and practicality of paired image datasets in real-world applications. In this paper, we focus on unpaired single image de-hazing and we do not rely on the ground truth image or physical scattering model. We reduce the image de-hazing problem to an image-to-image translation problem and propose a dehazing Global-Local Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (Dehaze-GLCGAN). Generator network of Dehaze-GLCGAN combines an encoder-decoder architecture with residual blocks to better recover the haze free scene. We also employ a global-local discriminator structure to deal with spatially varying haze. Through ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different factors in the performance of the proposed network. Our extensive experiments over three benchmark datasets show that our network outperforms previous work in terms of PSNR and SSIM while being trained on smaller amount of data compared to other methods.
