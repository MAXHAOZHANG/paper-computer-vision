### 1.TP-LSD: Tri-Points Based Line Segment Detector  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05505.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a novel deep convolutional model, Tri-Points Based Line Segment Detector (TP-LSD), to detect line segments in an image at real-time speed. The previous related methods typically use the two-step strategy, relying on either heuristic post-process or extra classifier. To realize one-step detection with a faster and more compact model, we introduce the tri-points representation, converting the line segment detection to the end-to-end prediction of a root-point and two endpoints for each line segment. TP-LSD has two branches: tri-points extraction branch and line segmentation branch. The former predicts the heat map of root-points and the two displacement maps of endpoints. The latter segments the pixels on straight lines out from background. Moreover, the line segmentation map is reused in the first branch as structural prior. We propose an additional novel evaluation metric and evaluate our method on Wireframe and YorkUrban datasets, demonstrating not only the competitive accuracy compared to the most recent methods, but also the real-time run speed up to 78 FPS with the $320\times 320$ input.      
### 2.MRZ code extraction from visa and passport documents using convolutional neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05489.pdf)
>  Detecting and extracting information from Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) on passports and visas is becoming increasingly important for verifying document authenticity. However, computer vision methods for performing similar tasks, such as optical character recognition (OCR), fail to extract the MRZ given digital images of passports with reasonable accuracy. We present a specially designed model based on convolutional neural networks that is able to successfully extract MRZ information from digital images of passports of arbitrary orientation and size. Our model achieved 100% MRZ detection rate and 98.36% character recognition macro-f1 score on a passport and visa dataset.      
### 3.Heterogeneous Domain Generalization via Domain Mixup  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05448.pdf)
>  One of the main drawbacks of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) is that they lack generalization capability. In this work, we focus on the problem of heterogeneous domain generalization which aims to improve the generalization capability across different tasks, which is, how to learn a DCNN model with multiple domain data such that the trained feature extractor can be generalized to supporting recognition of novel categories in a novel target domain. To solve this problem, we propose a novel heterogeneous domain generalization method by mixing up samples across multiple source domains with two different sampling strategies. Our experimental results based on the Visual Decathlon benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

### 4.ODIN: Automated Drift Detection and Recovery in Video Analytics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05440.pdf)
>  Recent advances in computer vision have led to a resurgence of interest in visual data analytics. Researchers are developing systems for effectively and efficiently analyzing visual data at scale. A significant challenge that these systems encounter lies in the drift in real-world visual data. For instance, a model for self-driving vehicles that is not trained on images containing snow does not work well when it encounters them in practice. This drift phenomenon limits the accuracy of models employed for visual data analytics. In this paper, we present a visual data analytics system, called ODIN, that automatically detects and recovers from drift. ODIN uses adversarial autoencoders to learn the distribution of high-dimensional images. We present an unsupervised algorithm for detecting drift by comparing the distributions of the given data against that of previously seen data. When ODIN detects drift, it invokes a drift recovery algorithm to deploy specialized models tailored towards the novel data points. These specialized models outperform their non-specialized counterpart on accuracy, performance, and memory footprint. Lastly, we present a model selection algorithm for picking an ensemble of best-fit specialized models to process a given input. We evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of ODIN on high-resolution dashboard camera videos captured under diverse environments from the Berkeley DeepDrive dataset. We demonstrate that ODIN's models deliver 6x higher throughput, 2x higher accuracy, and 6x smaller memory footprint compared to a baseline system without automated drift detection and recovery.      
### 5.Semi-Supervised Active Learning for COVID-19 Lung Ultrasound Multi-symptom Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05436.pdf)
>  Ultrasound (US) is a non-invasive yet effective medical diagnostic imaging technique for the COVID-19 global pandemic. However, due to complex feature behaviors and expensive annotations of US images, it is difficult to apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) assisting approaches for lung's multi-symptom (multi-label) classification. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a novel semi-supervised Two-Stream Active Learning (TSAL) method to model complicated features and reduce labeling costs in an iterative procedure. The core component of TSAL is the multi-label learning mechanism, in which label correlations information is used to design multi-label margin (MLM) strategy and confidence validation for automatically selecting informative samples and confident labels. On this basis, a multi-symptom multi-label (MSML) classification network is proposed to learn discriminative features of lung symptoms, and a human-machine interaction is exploited to confirm the final annotations that are used to fine-tune MSML with progressively labeled data. Moreover, a novel lung US dataset named COVID19-LUSMS is built, currently containing 71 clinical patients with 6,836 images sampled from 678 videos. Experimental evaluations show that TSAL using only 20% data can achieve superior performance to the baseline and the state-of-the-art. Qualitatively, visualization of both attention map and sample distribution confirms the good consistency with the clinic knowledge.      
### 6.Evaluation of the Robustness of Visual SLAM Methods in Different Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05427.pdf)
>  Determining the position and orientation of a sensor vis-a-vis its surrounding, while simultaneously mapping the environment around that sensor or simultaneous localization and mapping is quickly becoming an important advancement in embedded vision with a large number of different possible applications. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of the latest open-source SLAM algorithms with the main focus being their performance in different environmental surroundings. The chosen algorithms are evaluated on common publicly available datasets and the results reasoned with respect to the datasets' environment. This is the first stage of our main target of testing the methods in off-road scenarios.      
### 7.ZooBuilder: 2D and 3D Pose Estimation for Quadrupeds Using Synthetic Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05389.pdf)
>  This work introduces a novel strategy for generating synthetic training data for 2D and 3D pose estimation of animals using keyframe animations. With the objective to automate the process of creating animations for wildlife, we train several 2D and 3D pose estimation models with synthetic data, and put in place an end-to-end pipeline called ZooBuilder. The pipeline takes as input a video of an animal in the wild, and generates the corresponding 2D and 3D coordinates for each joint of the animal's skeleton. With this approach, we produce motion capture data that can be used to create animations for wildlife.      
### 8.Automatic cinematography for 360 video  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05388.pdf)
>  We describe our method for automatic generation of a visually interesting camera path (automatic cinematography)from a 360 video. Based on the information from the scene objects, multiple shot hypotheses for different shot types are constructed and the best one is rendered.      
### 9.Hybrid Space Learning for Language-based Video Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05381.pdf)
>  This paper attacks the challenging problem of video retrieval by text. In such a retrieval paradigm, an end user searches for unlabeled videos by ad-hoc queries described exclusively in the form of a natural-language sentence, with no visual example provided. Given videos as sequences of frames and queries as sequences of words, an effective sequence-to-sequence cross-modal matching is crucial. To that end, the two modalities need to be first encoded into real-valued vectors and then projected into a common space. In this paper we achieve this by proposing a dual deep encoding network that encodes videos and queries into powerful dense representations of their own. Our novelty is two-fold. First, different from prior art that resorts to a specific single-level encoder, the proposed network performs multi-level encoding that represents the rich content of both modalities in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Second, different from a conventional common space learning algorithm which is either concept based or latent space based, we introduce hybrid space learning which combines the high performance of the latent space and the good interpretability of the concept space. Dual encoding is conceptually simple, practically effective and end-to-end trained with hybrid space learning. Extensive experiments on four challenging video datasets show the viability of the new method.      
### 10.Critical analysis on the reproducibility of visual quality assessment using deep features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05369.pdf)
>  Data used to train supervised machine learning models are commonly split into independent training, validation, and test sets. In this paper we illustrate that intricate cases of data leakage have occurred in the no-reference video and image quality assessment literature. We show that the performance results of several recently published journal papers that are well above the best performances in related works, cannot be reached. Our analysis shows that information from the test set was inappropriately used in the training process in different ways. When correcting for the data leakage, the performances of the approaches drop below the state-of-the-art by a large margin. Additionally, we investigate end-to-end variations to the discussed approaches, which do not improve upon the original.      
### 11.Meta Learning for Few-Shot One-class Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05353.pdf)
>  We propose a method that can perform one-class classification given only a small number of examples from the target class and none from the others. We formulate the learning of meaningful features for one-class classification as a meta-learning problem in which the meta-training stage repeatedly simulates one-class classification, using the classification loss of the chosen algorithm to learn a feature representation. To learn these representations, we require only multiclass data from similar tasks. We show how the Support Vector Data Description method can be used with our method, and also propose a simpler variant based on Prototypical Networks that obtains comparable performance, indicating that learning feature representations directly from data may be more important than which one-class algorithm we choose. We validate our approach by adapting few-shot classification datasets to the few-shot one-class classification scenario, obtaining similar results to the state-of-the-art of traditional one-class classification, and that improves upon that of one-class classification baselines employed in the few-shot setting.      
### 12.The PREVENTION Challenge: How Good Are Humans Predicting Lane Changes?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05331.pdf)
>  While driving on highways, every driver tries to be aware of the behavior of surrounding vehicles, including possible emergency braking, evasive maneuvers trying to avoid obstacles, unexpected lane changes, or other emergencies that could lead to an accident. In this paper, human's ability to predict lane changes in highway scenarios is analyzed through the use of video sequences extracted from the PREVENTION dataset, a database focused on the development of research on vehicle intention and trajectory prediction. Thus, users had to indicate the moment at which they considered that a lane change maneuver was taking place in a target vehicle, subsequently indicating its direction: left or right. The results retrieved have been carefully analyzed and compared to ground truth labels, evaluating statistical models to understand whether humans can actually predict. The study has revealed that most participants are unable to anticipate lane-change maneuvers, detecting them after they have started. These results might serve as a baseline for AI's prediction ability evaluation, grading if those systems can outperform human skills by analyzing hidden cues that seem unnoticed, improving the detection time, and even anticipating maneuvers in some cases.      
### 13.SoFAr: Shortcut-based Fractal Architectures for Binary Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05317.pdf)
>  Binary Convolutional Neural Networks (BCNNs) can significantly improve the efficiency of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) for their deployment on resource-constrained platforms, such as mobile and embedded systems. However, the accuracy degradation of BCNNs is still considerable compared with their full precision counterpart, impeding their practical deployment. Because of the inevitable binarization error in the forward propagation and gradient mismatch problem in the backward propagation, it is nontrivial to train BCNNs to achieve satisfactory accuracy. To ease the difficulty of training, the shortcut-based BCNNs, such as residual connection-based Bi-real ResNet and dense connection-based BinaryDenseNet, introduce additional shortcuts in addition to the shortcuts already present in their full precision counterparts. Furthermore, fractal architectures have been also been used to improve the training process of full-precision DCNNs since the fractal structure triggers effects akin to deep supervision and lateral student-teacher information flow. Inspired by the shortcuts and fractal architectures, we propose two Shortcut-based Fractal Architectures (SoFAr) specifically designed for BCNNs: 1. residual connection-based fractal architectures for binary ResNet, and 2. dense connection-based fractal architectures for binary DenseNet. Our proposed SoFAr combines the adoption of shortcuts and the fractal architectures in one unified model, which is helpful in the training of BCNNs. Results show that our proposed SoFAr achieves better accuracy compared with shortcut-based BCNNs. Specifically, the Top-1 accuracy of our proposed RF-c4d8 ResNet37(41) and DRF-c2d2 DenseNet51(53) on ImageNet outperforms Bi-real ResNet18(64) and BinaryDenseNet51(32) by 3.29% and 1.41%, respectively, with the same computational complexity overhead.      
### 14.A Density-Aware PointRCNN for 3D Objection Detection in Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05307.pdf)
>  We present an improved version of PointRCNN for 3D object detection, in which a multi-branch backbone network is adopted to handle the non-uniform density of point clouds. An uncertainty-based sampling policy is proposed to deal with the distribution differences of different point clouds. The new model can achieve about 0.8 AP higher performance than the baseline PointRCNN on KITTI val set. In addition, a simplified model using a single scale grouping for each set-abstraction layer can achieve competitive performance with less computational cost.      
### 15.Enabling Image Recognition on Constrained Devices Using Neural Network Pruning and a CycleGAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05300.pdf)
>  Smart cameras are increasingly used in surveillance solutions in public spaces. Contemporary computer vision applications can be used to recognize events that require intervention by emergency services. Smart cameras can be mounted in locations where citizens feel particularly unsafe, e.g., pathways and underpasses with a history of incidents. One promising approach for smart cameras is edge AI, i.e., deploying AI technology on IoT devices. However, implementing resource-demanding technology such as image recognition using deep neural networks (DNN) on constrained devices is a substantial challenge. In this paper, we explore two approaches to reduce the need for compute in contemporary image recognition in an underpass. First, we showcase successful neural network pruning, i.e., we retain comparable classification accuracy with only 1.1\% of the neurons remaining from the state-of-the-art DNN architecture. Second, we demonstrate how a CycleGAN can be used to transform out-of-distribution images to the operational design domain. We posit that both pruning and CycleGANs are promising enablers for efficient edge AI in smart cameras.      
### 16.Unsupervised Partial Point Set Registration via Joint Shape Completion and Registration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05290.pdf)
>  We propose a self-supervised method for partial point set registration. While recent proposed learning-based methods have achieved impressive registration performance on the full shape observations, these methods mostly suffer from performance degradation when dealing with partial shapes. To bridge the performance gaps between partial point set registration with full point set registration, we proposed to incorporate a shape completion network to benefit the registration process. To achieve this, we design a latent code for each pair of shapes, which can be regarded as a geometric encoding of the target shape. By doing so, our model does need an explicit feature embedding network to learn the feature encodings. More importantly, both our shape completion network and the point set registration network take the shared latent codes as input, which are optimized along with the parameters of two decoder networks in the training process. Therefore, the point set registration process can thus benefit from the joint optimization process of latent codes, which are enforced to represent the information of full shape instead of partial ones. In the inference stage, we fix the network parameter and optimize the latent codes to get the optimal shape completion and registration results. Our proposed method is pure unsupervised and does not need any ground truth supervision. Experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for partial point set registration.      
### 17.Attribute-conditioned Layout GAN for Automatic Graphic Design  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05284.pdf)
>  Modeling layout is an important first step for graphic design. Recently, methods for generating graphic layouts have progressed, particularly with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, the problem of specifying the locations and sizes of design elements usually involves constraints with respect to element attributes, such as area, aspect ratio and reading-order. Automating attribute conditional graphic layouts remains a complex and unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce Attribute-conditioned Layout GAN to incorporate the attributes of design elements for graphic layout generation by forcing both the generator and the discriminator to meet attribute conditions. Due to the complexity of graphic designs, we further propose an element dropout method to make the discriminator look at partial lists of elements and learn their local patterns. In addition, we introduce various loss designs following different design principles for layout optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed method can synthesize graphic layouts conditioned on different element attributes. It can also adjust well-designed layouts to new sizes while retaining elements' original reading-orders. The effectiveness of our method is validated through a user study.      
### 18.Fairness Matters -- A Data-Driven Framework Towards Fair and High Performing Facial Recognition Systems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05283.pdf)
>  Facial recognition technologies are widely used in governmental and industrial applications. Together with the advancements in deep learning (DL), human-centric tasks such as accurate age prediction based on face images become feasible. However, the issue of fairness when predicting the age for different ethnicity and gender remains an open problem. Policing systems use age to estimate the likelihood of someone to commit a crime, where younger suspects tend to be more likely involved. Unfair age prediction may lead to unfair treatment of humans not only in crime prevention but also in marketing, identity acquisition and authentication. Therefore, this work follows two parts. First, an empirical study is conducted evaluating performance and fairness of state-of-the-art systems for age prediction including baseline and most recent works of academia and the main industrial service providers (Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure). Building on the findings we present a novel approach to mitigate unfairness and enhance performance, using distribution-aware dataset curation and augmentation. Distribution-awareness is based on out-of-distribution detection which is utilized to validate equal and diverse DL system behavior towards e.g. ethnicity and gender. In total we train 24 DNN models and utilize one million data points to assess performance and fairness of the state-of-the-art for face recognition algorithms. We demonstrate an improvement in mean absolute age prediction error from 7.70 to 3.39 years and a 4-fold increase in fairness towards ethnicity when compared to related work. Utilizing the presented methodology we are able to outperform leading industry players such as Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure in both fairness and age prediction accuracy and provide the necessary guidelines to assess quality and enhance face recognition systems based on DL techniques.      
### 19.AFP-SRC: Identification of Antifreeze Proteins Using Sparse Representation Classifier  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05277.pdf)
>  Species living in the extreme cold environment fight against the harsh conditions by virtue of antifreeze proteins (AFPs), that manipulates the freezing mechanism of water in more than one way. This amazing nature of AFP turns out to be extremely useful in a number of industrial and medical applications. The lack of similarity in their structure and sequence makes their prediction an arduous task and identifying them experimentally in the wet-lab is time consuming and expensive. In this research, we propose a computational framework for the prediction of AFPs which is essentially based on a sample-specific classification method using the sparse reconstruction. A linear model and an over-complete dictionary matrix of known AFPs is used to predict sparse class-label vector which provides sample-association score. Delta-rule is applied for the reconstruction of two pseudo-samples using lower and upper parts of sample-association vector and based on the minimum recovery score, class labels are assigned. We compare our approach with contemporary methods on a standard dataset and the proposed method is found to outperform in terms of Matthews correlation coefficient and Youden's index. The MATLAB implementation of proposed method is available at author's github page <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Shujaat123/AFP-SRC" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 20.Image Conditioned Keyframe-Based Video Summarization Using Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05269.pdf)
>  Video summarization plays an important role in selecting keyframe for understanding a video. Traditionally, it aims to find the most representative and diverse contents (or frames) in a video for short summaries. Recently, query-conditioned video summarization has been introduced, which considers user queries to learn more user-oriented summaries and its preference. However, there are obstacles in text queries for user subjectivity and finding similarity between the user query and input frames. In this work, (i) Image is introduced as a query for user preference (ii) a mathematical model is proposed to minimize redundancy based on the loss function &amp; summary variance and (iii) the similarity score between the query image and input video to obtain the summarized video. Furthermore, the Object-based Query Image (OQI) dataset has been introduced, which contains the query images. The proposed method has been validated using UT Egocentric (UTE) dataset. The proposed model successfully resolved the issues of (i) user preference, (ii) recognize important frames and selecting that keyframe in daily life videos, with different illumination conditions. The proposed method achieved 57.06% average F1-Score for UTE dataset and outperforms the existing state-of-theart by 11.01%. The process time is 7.81 times faster than actual time of video Experiments on a recently proposed UTE dataset show the efficiency of the proposed method      
### 21.PiaNet: A pyramid input augmented convolutional neural network for GGO detection in 3D lung CT scans  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05267.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a new convolutional neural network with multiscale processing for detecting ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules in 3D computed tomography (CT) images, which is referred to as PiaNet for short. PiaNet consists of a feature-extraction module and a prediction module. The former module is constructed by introducing pyramid multiscale source connections into a contracting-expanding structure. The latter module includes a bounding-box regressor and a classifier that are employed to simultaneously recognize GGO nodules and estimate bounding boxes at multiple scales. To train the proposed PiaNet, a two-stage transfer learning strategy is developed. In the first stage, the feature-extraction module is embedded into a classifier network that is trained on a large data set of GGO and non-GGO patches, which are generated by performing data augmentation from a small number of annotated CT scans. In the second stage, the pretrained feature-extraction module is loaded into PiaNet, and then PiaNet is fine-tuned using the annotated CT scans. We evaluate the proposed PiaNet on the LIDC-IDRI data set. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts, including the Subsolid CAD and Aidence systems and S4ND and GA-SSD methods. PiaNet achieves a sensitivity of 91.75% with only one false positive per scan      
### 22.Novel and Effective CNN-Based Binarization for Historically Degraded As-built Drawing Maps  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05252.pdf)
>  Binarizing historically degraded as-built drawing (HDAD) maps is a new challenging job, especially in terms of removing the three artifacts, namely noise, the yellowing areas, and the folded lines, while preserving the foreground components well. In this paper, we first propose a semi-automatic labeling method to create the HDAD-pair dataset of which each HDAD-pair consists of one HDAD map and its binarized HDAD map. Based on the created training HDAD-pair dataset, we propose a convolutional neural network-based (CNN-based) binarization method to produce high-quality binarized HDAD maps. Based on the testing HDAD maps, the thorough experimental data demonstrated that in terms of the accuracy, PSNR (peak-signal-to-noise-ratio), and the perceptual effect of the binarized HDAD maps, our method substantially outperforms the nine existing binarization methods. In addition, with similar accuracy, the experimental results demonstrated the significant execution-time reduction merit of our method relative to the retrained version of the state-of-the-art CNN-based binarization methods.      
### 23.Devil's in the Detail: Graph-based Key-point Alignment and Embedding for Person Re-ID  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05250.pdf)
>  Although Person Re-Identification has made impressive progress, difficult cases like occlusion, change of view-point and similar clothing still bring great challenges. Besides overall visual features, matching and comparing detailed local information is also essential for tackling these challenges. This paper proposes two key recognition patterns to better utilize the local information of pedestrian images. From the spatial perspective, the model should be able to select and align key-points from the image pairs for comparison (i.e. key-points alignment). From the perspective of feature channels, the feature of a query image should be dynamically adjusted based on the gallery image it needs to match (i.e. conditional feature embedding). Most of the existing methods are unable to satisfy both key-point alignment and conditional feature embedding. By introducing novel techniques including correspondence attention module and discrepancy-based GCN, we propose an end-to-end ReID method that integrates both patterns into a unified framework, called Siamese-GCN. The experiments show that Siamese-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets.      
### 24.Optimizing Convolutional Neural Network Architecture via Information Field  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05236.pdf)
>  CNN architecture design has attracted tremendous attention of improving model accuracy or reducing model complexity. However, existing works either introduce repeated training overhead in the search process or lack an interpretable metric to guide the design. To clear the hurdles, we propose Information Field (IF), an explainable and easy-to-compute metric, to estimate the quality of a CNN architecture and guide the search process of designs. To validate the effectiveness of IF, we build a static optimizer to improve the CNN architectures at both the stage level and the kernel level. Our optimizer not only provides a clear and reproducible procedure but also mitigates unnecessary training efforts in the architecture search process. Experiments show that the models generated by our optimizer can achieve up to 5.47% accuracy improvement and up to 65.38% parameters deduction, compared with state-of-the-art CNN structures like MobileNet and ResNet.      
### 25.Spectral Analysis Network for Deep Representation Learning and Image Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05235.pdf)
>  Deep representation learning is a crucial procedure in multimedia analysis and attracts increasing attention. Most of the popular techniques rely on convolutional neural network and require a large amount of labeled data in the training procedure. However, it is time consuming or even impossible to obtain the label information in some tasks due to cost limitation. Thus, it is necessary to develop unsupervised deep representation learning techniques. This paper proposes a new network structure for unsupervised deep representation learning based on spectral analysis, which is a popular technique with solid theory foundations. Compared with the existing spectral analysis methods, the proposed network structure has at least three advantages. Firstly, it can identify the local similarities among images in patch level and thus more robust against occlusion. Secondly, through multiple consecutive spectral analysis procedures, the proposed network can learn more clustering-friendly representations and is capable to reveal the deep correlations among data samples. Thirdly, it can elegantly integrate different spectral analysis procedures, so that each spectral analysis procedure can have their individual strengths in dealing with different data sample distributions. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods on various image clustering tasks.      
### 26.An unsupervised deep learning framework via integrated optimization of representation learning and GMM-based modeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05234.pdf)
>  While supervised deep learning has achieved great success in a range of applications, relatively little work has studied the discovery of knowledge from unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised deep learning framework to provide a potential solution for the problem that existing deep learning techniques require large labeled data sets for completing the training process. Our proposed introduces a new principle of joint learning on both deep representations and GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)-based deep modeling, and thus an integrated objective function is proposed to facilitate the principle. In comparison with the existing work in similar areas, our objective function has two learning targets, which are created to be jointly optimized to achieve the best possible unsupervised learning and knowledge discovery from unlabeled data sets. While maximizing the first target enables the GMM to achieve the best possible modeling of the data representations and each Gaussian component corresponds to a compact cluster, maximizing the second term will enhance the separability of the Gaussian components and hence the inter-cluster distances. As a result, the compactness of clusters is significantly enhanced by reducing the intra-cluster distances, and the separability is improved by increasing the inter-cluster distances. Extensive experimental results show that the propose method can improve the clustering performance compared with benchmark methods.      
### 27.Conditional Coupled Generative Adversarial Networks for Zero-Shot Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05228.pdf)
>  Machine learning models trained in one domain perform poorly in the other domains due to the existence of domain shift. Domain adaptation techniques solve this problem by training transferable models from the label-rich source domain to the label-scarce target domain. Unfortunately, a majority of the existing domain adaptation techniques rely on the availability of target-domain data, and thus limit their applications to a small community across few computer vision problems. In this paper, we tackle the challenging zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) problem, where target-domain data is non-available in the training stage. For this purpose, we propose conditional coupled generative adversarial networks (CoCoGAN) by extending the coupled generative adversarial networks (CoGAN) into a conditioning model. Compared with the existing state of the arts, our proposed CoCoGAN is able to capture the joint distribution of dual-domain samples in two different tasks, i.e. the relevant task (RT) and an irrelevant task (IRT). We train CoCoGAN with both source-domain samples in RT and dual-domain samples in IRT to complete the domain adaptation. While the former provide high-level concepts of the non-available target-domain data, the latter carry the sharing correlation between the two domains in RT and IRT. To train CoCoGAN in the absence of target-domain data for RT, we propose a new supervisory signal, i.e. the alignment between representations across tasks. Extensive experiments carried out demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGAN outperforms existing state of the arts in image classifications.      
### 28.HAA500: Human-Centric Atomic Action Dataset with Curated Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05224.pdf)
>  We contribute HAA500, a manually annotated human-centric atomic action dataset for action recognition on 500 classes with over 591k labeled frames. Unlike existing atomic action datasets, where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with action-verbs, e.g., "Throw", HAA500 contains fine-grained atomic actions where only consistent actions fall under the same label, e.g., "Baseball Pitching" vs "Free Throw in Basketball", to minimize ambiguities in action classification. HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the movement of human figures with less spatio-temporal label noises to greatly enhance the training of deep neural networks. The advantages of HAA500 include: 1) human-centric actions with a high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) each video captures the essential elements of an atomic action without irrelevant frames; 3) fine-grained atomic action classes. Our extensive experiments validate the benefits of human-centric and atomic characteristics of HAA, which enables the trained model to improve prediction by attending to atomic human poses. We detail the HAA500 dataset statistics and collection methodology, and compare quantitatively with existing action recognition datasets.      
### 29.Adversarial Learning for Zero-shot Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05214.pdf)
>  Zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) is a category of domain adaptation problems where neither data sample nor label is available for parameter learning in the target domain. With the hypothesis that the shift between a given pair of domains is shared across tasks, we propose a new method for ZSDA by transferring domain shift from an irrelevant task (IrT) to the task of interest (ToI). Specifically, we first identify an IrT, where dual-domain samples are available, and capture the domain shift with a coupled generative adversarial networks (CoGAN) in this task. Then, we train a CoGAN for the ToI and restrict it to carry the same domain shift as the CoGAN for IrT does. In addition, we introduce a pair of co-training classifiers to regularize the training procedure of CoGAN in the ToI. The proposed method not only derives machine learning models for the non-available target-domain data, but also synthesizes the data themselves. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performances.      
### 30.Variance Loss: A Confidence-Based Reweighting Strategy for Coarse Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05205.pdf)
>  Coarsely-labeled semantic segmentation annotations are easy to obtain, but therefore bear the risk of losing edge details and introducing background noise. Though they are usually used as a supplement to the finely-labeled ones, in this paper, we attempt to train a model only using these coarse annotations, and improve the model performance with a noise-robust reweighting strategy. Specifically, the proposed confidence indicator makes it possible to design a reweighting strategy that simultaneously mines hard samples and alleviates noisy labels for the coarse annotation. Besides, the optimal reweighting strategy can be automatically derived by our Adversarial Weight Assigning Module (AWAM) with only 53 learnable parameters. Moreover, a rigorous proof of the convergence of AWAM is given. Experiments on standard datasets show that our proposed reweighting strategy can bring consistent performance improvements for both coarse annotations and fine annotations. In particular, built on top of DeeplabV3+, we improve the mIoU on Cityscapes Coarse dataset (coarsely-labeled) and ADE20K (finely-labeled) by 2.21 and 0.91, respectively.      
### 31.OCR Graph Features for Manipulation Detection in Documents  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05158.pdf)
>  Detecting manipulations in digital documents is becoming increasingly important for information verification purposes. Due to the proliferation of image editing software, altering key information in documents has become widely accessible. Nearly all approaches in this domain rely on a procedural approach, using carefully generated features and a hand-tuned scoring system, rather than a data-driven and generalizable approach. We frame this issue as a graph comparison problem using the character bounding boxes, and propose a model that leverages graph features using OCR (Optical Character Recognition). Our model relies on a data-driven approach to detect alterations by training a random forest classifier on the graph-based OCR features. We evaluate our algorithm's forgery detection performance on dataset constructed from real business documents with slight forgery imperfections. Our proposed model dramatically outperforms the most closely-related document manipulation detection model on this task.      
### 32.A new heuristic algorithm for fast k-segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05148.pdf)
>  The $k$-segmentation of a video stream is used to partition it into $k$ piecewise-linear segments, so that each linear segment has a meaningful interpretation. Such segmentation may be used to summarize large videos using a small set of images, to identify anomalies within segments and change points between segments, and to select critical subsets for training machine learning models. Exact and approximate segmentation methods for $k$-segmentation exist in the literature. Each of these algorithms occupies a different spot in the trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. A novel heuristic algorithm is proposed in this paper to improve upon existing methods. It is empirically found to provide accuracies competitive with exact methods at a fraction of the computational expense. <br>The new algorithm is inspired by Lloyd's algorithm for K-Means and Lloyd-Max algorithm for scalar quantization, and is called the LM algorithm for convenience. It works by iteratively minimizing a cost function from any given initialisation; the commonly used $L_2$ cost is chosen in this paper. While the greedy minimization makes the algorithm sensitive to initialisation, the ability to converge from any initial guess to a local optimum allows the algorithm to be integrated into other existing algorithms. Three variants of the algorithm are tested over a large number of synthetic datasets, one being a standalone LM implementation, and two others that combine with existing algorithms. One of the latter two -- LM-enhanced-Bottom-Up segmentation -- is found to have the best accuracy and the lowest computational complexity among all algorithms. This variant of LM can provide $k$-segmentations over data sets with up to a million image frames within several seconds.      
### 33.Practical Cross-modal Manifold Alignment for Grounded Language  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05147.pdf)
>  We propose a cross-modality manifold alignment procedure that leverages triplet loss to jointly learn consistent, multi-modal embeddings of language-based concepts of real-world items. Our approach learns these embeddings by sampling triples of anchor, positive, and negative data points from RGB-depth images and their natural language descriptions. We show that our approach can benefit from, but does not require, post-processing steps such as Procrustes analysis, in contrast to some of our baselines which require it for reasonable performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two datasets commonly used to develop robotic-based grounded language learning systems, where our approach outperforms four baselines, including a state-of-the-art approach, across five evaluation metrics.      
### 34.Auto-encoders for Track Reconstruction in Drift Chambers for CLAS12  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05144.pdf)
>  In this article we describe the development of machine learning models to assist the CLAS12 tracking algorithm by identifying tracks through inferring missing segments in the drift chambers. Auto encoders are used to reconstruct missing segments from track trajectory. Implemented neural network was able to reliably reconstruct missing segment positions with accuracy of $\approx 0.35$ wires, and lead to recovery of missing tracks with accuracy of $&gt;99.8\%$.      
### 35.SWP-Leaf NET: a novel multistage approach for plant leaf identification based on deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05139.pdf)
>  Modern scientific and technological advances are allowing botanists to use computer vision-based approaches for plant identification tasks. These approaches have their own challenges. Leaf classification is a computer-vision task performed for the automated identification of plant species, a serious challenge due to variations in leaf morphology, including its size, texture, shape, and venation. Researchers have recently become more inclined toward deep learning-based methods rather than conventional feature-based methods due to the popularity and successful implementation of deep learning methods in image analysis, object recognition, and speech recognition. In this paper, a botanist's behavior was modeled in leaf identification by proposing a highly-efficient method of maximum behavioral resemblance developed through three deep learning-based models. Different layers of the three models were visualized to ensure that the botanist's behavior was modeled accurately. The first and second models were designed from scratch.Regarding the third model, the pre-trained architecture MobileNetV2 was employed along with the transfer-learning technique. The proposed method was evaluated on two well-known datasets: Flavia and MalayaKew. According to a comparative analysis, the suggested approach was more accurate than hand-crafted feature extraction methods and other deep learning techniques in terms of 99.67% and 99.81% accuracy. Unlike conventional techniques that have their own specific complexities and depend on datasets, the proposed method required no hand-crafted feature extraction, and also increased accuracy and distributability as compared with other deep learning techniques. It was further considerably faster than other methods because it used shallower networks with fewer parameters and did not use all three models recurrently.      
### 36.1st Place Solution to Google Landmark Retrieval 2020  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05132.pdf)
>  This paper presents the 1st place solution to the Google Landmark Retrieval 2020 Competition on Kaggle. The solution is based on metric learning to classify numerous landmark classes, and uses transfer learning with two train datasets, fine-tuning on bigger images, adjusting loss weight for cleaner samples, and esemble to enhance the model's performance further. Finally, it scored 0.38677 mAP@100 on the private leaderboard.      
### 37.Dynamic Future Net: Diversified Human Motion Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05109.pdf)
>  Human motion modelling is crucial in many areas such as computer graphics, vision and virtual reality. Acquiring high-quality skeletal motions is difficult due to the need for specialized equipment and laborious manual post-posting, which necessitates maximizing the use of existing data to synthesize new data. However, it is a challenge due to the intrinsic motion stochasticity of human motion dynamics, manifested in the short and long terms. In the short term, there is strong randomness within a couple frames, e.g. one frame followed by multiple possible frames leading to different motion styles; while in the long term, there are non-deterministic action transitions. In this paper, we present Dynamic Future Net, a new deep learning model where we explicitly focuses on the aforementioned motion stochasticity by constructing a generative model with non-trivial modelling capacity in temporal stochasticity. Given limited amounts of data, our model can generate a large number of high-quality motions with arbitrary duration, and visually-convincing variations in both space and time. We evaluate our model on a wide range of motions and compare it with the state-of-the-art methods. Both qualitative and quantitative results show the superiority of our method, for its robustness, versatility and high-quality.      
### 38.Bayesian Geodesic Regression onRiemannian Manifolds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05108.pdf)
>  Geodesic regression has been proposed for fitting the geodesic curve. However, it cannot automatically choose the dimensionality of data. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian geodesic regression model on Riemannian manifolds (BGRM) model. To avoid the overfitting problem, we add a regularization term to control the effectiveness of the model. To automatically select the dimensionality, we develop a prior for the geodesic regression model, which can automatically select the number of relevant dimensions by driving unnecessary tangent vectors to zero. To show the validation of our model, we first apply it in the 3D synthetic sphere and 2D pentagon data. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in reducing the dimensionality and analyzing shape variations of human corpus callosum and mandible data.      
### 39.Efficiently Constructing Adversarial Examples by Feature Watermarking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05107.pdf)
>  With the increasing attentions of deep learning models, attacks are also upcoming for such models. For example, an attacker may carefully construct images in specific ways (also referred to as adversarial examples) aiming to mislead the deep learning models to output incorrect classification results. Similarly, many efforts are proposed to detect and mitigate adversarial examples, usually for certain dedicated attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel digital watermark based method to generate adversarial examples for deep learning models. Specifically, partial main features of the watermark image are embedded into the host image invisibly, aiming to tamper and damage the recognition capabilities of the deep learning models. We devise an efficient mechanism to select host images and watermark images, and utilize the improved discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm and the modified discrete cosine transform (DCT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm. The experimental results showed that our scheme is able to generate a large number of adversarial examples efficiently. In addition, we find that using the extracted features of the image as the watermark images, can increase the success rate of an attack under certain conditions with minimal changes to the host image. To ensure repeatability, reproducibility, and code sharing, the source code is available on GitHub      
### 40.What am I allowed to do here?: Online Learning of Context-Specific Norms by Pepper  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05105.pdf)
>  Social norms support coordination and cooperation in society. With social robots becoming increasingly involved in our society, they also need to follow the social norms of the society. This paper presents a computational framework for learning contexts and the social norms present in a context in an online manner on a robot. The paper utilizes a recent state-of-the-art approach for incremental learning and adapts it for online learning of scenes (contexts). The paper further utilizes Dempster-Schafer theory to model context-specific norms. After learning the scenes (contexts), we use active learning to learn related norms. We test our approach on the Pepper robot by taking it through different scene locations. Our results show that Pepper can learn different scenes and related norms simply by communicating with a human partner in an online manner.      
### 41.Emotion-Based End-to-End Matching Between Image and Music in Valence-Arousal Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05103.pdf)
>  Both images and music can convey rich semantics and are widely used to induce specific emotions. Matching images and music with similar emotions might help to make emotion perceptions more vivid and stronger. Existing emotion-based image and music matching methods either employ limited categorical emotion states which cannot well reflect the complexity and subtlety of emotions, or train the matching model using an impractical multi-stage pipeline. In this paper, we study end-to-end matching between image and music based on emotions in the continuous valence-arousal (VA) space. First, we construct a large-scale dataset, termed Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet), with over 140K image-music pairs. Second, we propose cross-modal deep continuous metric learning (CDCML) to learn a shared latent embedding space which preserves the cross-modal similarity relationship in the continuous matching space. Finally, we refine the embedding space by further preserving the single-modal emotion relationship in the VA spaces of both images and music. The metric learning in the embedding space and task regression in the label space are jointly optimized for both cross-modal matching and single-modal VA prediction. The extensive experiments conducted on IMEMNet demonstrate the superiority of CDCML for emotion-based image and music matching as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 42.Data-Level Recombination and Lightweight Fusion Scheme for RGB-D Salient Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05102.pdf)
>  Existing RGB-D salient object detection methods treat depth information as an independent component to complement its RGB part, and widely follow the bi-stream parallel network architecture. To selectively fuse the CNNs features extracted from both RGB and depth as a final result, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) bi-stream networks usually consist of two independent subbranches; i.e., one subbranch is used for RGB saliency and the other aims for depth saliency. However, its depth saliency is persistently inferior to the RGB saliency because the RGB component is intrinsically more informative than the depth component. The bi-stream architecture easily biases its subsequent fusion procedure to the RGB subbranch, leading to a performance bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a novel data-level recombination strategy to fuse RGB with D (depth) before deep feature extraction, where we cyclically convert the original 4-dimensional RGB-D into \textbf{D}GB, R\textbf{D}B and RG\textbf{D}. Then, a newly lightweight designed triple-stream network is applied over these novel formulated data to achieve an optimal channel-wise complementary fusion status between the RGB and D, achieving a new SOTA performance.      
### 43.Vision at A Glance: Interplay between Fine and Coarse Information Processing Pathways  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05101.pdf)
>  Object recognition is often viewed as a feedforward, bottom-up process in machine learning, but in real neural systems, object recognition is a complicated process which involves the interplay between two signal pathways. One is the parvocellular pathway (P-pathway), which is slow and extracts fine features of objects; the other is the magnocellular pathway (M-pathway), which is fast and extracts coarse features of objects. It has been suggested that the interplay between the two pathways endows the neural system with the capacity of processing visual information rapidly, adaptively, and robustly. However, the underlying computational mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we build a computational model to elucidate the computational advantages associated with the interactions between two pathways. Our model consists of two convolution neural networks: one mimics the P-pathway, referred to as FineNet, which is deep, has small-size kernels, and receives detailed visual inputs; the other mimics the M-pathway, referred to as CoarseNet, which is shallow, has large-size kernels, and receives low-pass filtered or binarized visual inputs. The two pathways interact with each other via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We find that: 1) FineNet can teach CoarseNet through imitation and improve its performance considerably; 2) CoarseNet can improve the noise robustness of FineNet through association; 3) the output of CoarseNet can serve as a cognitive bias to improve the performance of FineNet. We hope that this study will provide insight into understanding visual information processing and inspire the development of new object recognition architectures.      
### 44.Adversarial score matching and improved sampling for image generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05475.pdf)
>  Denoising score matching with Annealed Langevin Sampling (DSM-ALS) is a recent approach to generative modeling. Despite the convincing visual quality of samples, this method appears to perform worse than Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) under the Fréchet Inception Distance, a popular metric for generative models. We show that this apparent gap vanishes when denoising the final Langevin samples using the score network. In addition, we propose two improvements to DSM-ALS: 1) Consistent Annealed Sampling as a more stable alternative to Annealed Langevin Sampling, and 2) a hybrid training formulation,composed of both denoising score matching and adversarial objectives. By combining both of these techniques and exploring different network architectures, we elevate score matching methods and obtain results competitive with state-of-the-art image generation on CIFAR-10.      
### 45.Object Recognition for Economic Development from Daytime Satellite Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05455.pdf)
>  Reliable data about the stock of physical capital and infrastructure in developing countries is typically very scarce. This is particular a problem for data at the subnational level where existing data is often outdated, not consistently measured or coverage is incomplete. Traditional data collection methods are time and labor-intensive costly, which often prohibits developing countries from collecting this type of data. This paper proposes a novel method to extract infrastructure features from high-resolution satellite images. We collected high-resolution satellite images for 5 million 1km $\times$ 1km grid cells covering 21 African countries. We contribute to the growing body of literature in this area by training our machine learning algorithm on ground-truth data. We show that our approach strongly improves the predictive accuracy. Our methodology can build the foundation to then predict subnational indicators of economic development for areas where this data is either missing or unreliable.      
### 46.Embodied Visual Navigation with Automatic Curriculum Learning in Real Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05429.pdf)
>  We present NavACL, a method of automatic curriculum learning tailored to the navigation task. NavACL is simple to train and efficiently selects relevant tasks using geometric features. In our experiments, deep reinforcement learning agents trained using NavACL in collision-free environments significantly outperform state-of-the-art agents trained with uniform sampling -- the current standard. Furthermore, our agents are able to navigate through unknown cluttered indoor environments to semantically-specified targets using only RGB images. Collision avoidance policies and frozen feature networks support transfer to unseen real-world environments, without any modification or retraining requirements. We evaluate our policies in simulation, and in the real world on a ground robot and a quadrotor drone. Videos of real-world results are available in the supplementary material      
### 47.Phase Sampling Profilometry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05406.pdf)
>  Structured light 3D surface imaging is a school of techniques in which structured light patterns are used for measuring the depth map of the object. Among all the designed structured light patterns, phase pattern has become most popular because of its high resolution and high accuracy. Accordingly, phase measuring profolimetry (PMP) has become the mainstream of structured light technology. In this letter, we introduce the concept of phase sampling profilometry (PSP) that calculates the phase unambiguously in the spatial-frequency domain with only one pattern image. Therefore, PSP is capable of measuring the 3D shapes of the moving objects robustly with single-shot.      
### 48.COVIDNet-CT: A Tailored Deep Convolutional Neural Network Design for Detection of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05383.pdf)
>  The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a tremendous impact on patients and healthcare systems around the world. In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative. While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that releasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.      
### 49.Disentangling Neural Architectures and Weights: A Case Study in Supervised Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05346.pdf)
>  The history of deep learning has shown that human-designed problem-specific networks can greatly improve the classification performance of general neural models. In most practical cases, however, choosing the optimal architecture for a given task remains a challenging problem. Recent architecture-search methods are able to automatically build neural models with strong performance but fail to fully appreciate the interaction between neural architecture and weights. This work investigates the problem of disentangling the role of the neural structure and its edge weights, by showing that well-trained architectures may not need any link-specific fine-tuning of the weights. We compare the performance of such weight-free networks (in our case these are binary networks with {0, 1}-valued weights) with random, weight-agnostic, pruned and standard fully connected networks. To find the optimal weight-agnostic network, we use a novel and computationally efficient method that translates the hard architecture-search problem into a feasible optimization problem.More specifically, we look at the optimal task-specific architectures as the optimal configuration of binary networks with {0, 1}-valued weights, which can be found through an approximate gradient descent strategy. Theoretical convergence guarantees of the proposed algorithm are obtained by bounding the error in the gradient approximation and its practical performance is evaluated on two real-world data sets. For measuring the structural similarities between different architectures, we use a novel spectral approach that allows us to underline the intrinsic differences between real-valued networks and weight-free architectures.      
### 50.Visually Analyzing and Steering Zero Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05254.pdf)
>  We propose a visual analytics system to help a user analyze and steer zero-shot learning models. Zero-shot learning has emerged as a viable scenario for categorizing data that consists of no labeled examples, and thus a promising approach to minimize data annotation from humans. However, it is challenging to understand where zero-shot learning fails, the cause of such failures, and how a user can modify the model to prevent such failures. Our visualization system is designed to help users diagnose and understand mispredictions in such models, so that they may gain insight on the behavior of a model when applied to data associated with categories not seen during training. Through usage scenarios, we highlight how our system can help a user improve performance in zero-shot learning.      
### 51.Defending Against Multiple and Unforeseen Adversarial Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05244.pdf)
>  Adversarial examples of deep neural networks have been actively investigated on image-based classification, segmentation and detection tasks. However, adversarial robustness of video models still lacks exploration. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial videos, only a handful of approaches pertaining to the defense strategies have been published in the literature. Furthermore, these defense methods are limited to a single perturbation type and often fail to provide robustness to Lp-bounded attacks and physically realizable attacks simultaneously. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense solutions against multiple adversarial video types for video classification. The proposed approach performs adversarial training with multiple types of video adversaries using independent batch normalizations (BNs), and recognizes different adversaries by an adversarial video detector. During inference, a switch module sends an input to a proper batch normalization branch according to the detected attack type. Compared to conventional adversarial training, our method exhibits stronger robustness to multiple and even unforeseen adversarial videos and provides higher classification accuracy.      
### 52.Weakly Supervised Content Selection for Improved Image Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05175.pdf)
>  Image captioning involves identifying semantic concepts in the scene and describing them in fluent natural language. Recent approaches do not explicitly model the semantic concepts and train the model only for the end goal of caption generation. Such models lack interpretability and controllability, primarily due to sub-optimal content selection. We address this problem by breaking down the captioning task into two simpler, manageable and more controllable tasks -- skeleton prediction and skeleton-based caption generation. We approach the former as a weakly supervised task, using a simple off-the-shelf language syntax parser and avoiding the need for additional human annotations; the latter uses a supervised-learning approach. We investigate three methods of conditioning the caption on skeleton in the encoder, decoder and both. Our compositional model generates significantly better quality captions on out of domain test images, as judged by human annotators. Additionally, we demonstrate the cross-language effectiveness of the English skeleton to other languages including French, Italian, German, Spanish and Hindi. This compositional nature of captioning exhibits the potential of unpaired image captioning, thereby reducing the dependence on expensive image-caption pairs. Furthermore, we investigate the use of skeletons as a knob to control certain properties of the generated image caption, such as length, content, and gender expression.      
### 53.COVID CT-Net: Predicting Covid-19 From Chest CT Images Using Attentional Convolutional Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05096.pdf)
>  The novel corona-virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a major outbreak in more than 200 countries around the world, leading to a severe impact on the health and life of many people globally. As of Aug 25th of 2020, more than 20 million people are infected, and more than 800,000 death are reported. Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used as a as an alternative to the time-consuming "reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)" test, to detect COVID-19. In this work we developed a deep learning framework to predict COVID-19 from CT images. We propose to use an attentional convolution network, which can focus on the infected areas of chest, enabling it to perform a more accurate prediction. We trained our model on a dataset of more than 2000 CT images, and report its performance in terms of various popular metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve, and also precision-recall curve, and achieve very promising results. We also provide a visualization of the attention maps of the model for several test images, and show that our model is attending to the infected regions as intended. In addition to developing a machine learning modeling framework, we also provide the manual annotation of the potentionally infected regions of chest, with the help of a board-certified radiologist, and make that publicly available for other researchers.
