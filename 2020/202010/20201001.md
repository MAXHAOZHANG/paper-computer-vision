### 1.3D Dense Geometry-Guided Facial Expression Synthesis by Adversarial Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14798.pdf)
>  Manipulating facial expressions is a challenging task due to fine-grained shape changes produced by facial muscles and the lack of input-output pairs for supervised learning. Unlike previous methods using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), which rely on cycle-consistency loss or sparse geometry (landmarks) loss for expression synthesis, we propose a novel GAN framework to exploit 3D dense (depth and surface normals) information for expression manipulation. However, a large-scale dataset containing RGB images with expression annotations and their corresponding depth maps is not available. To this end, we propose to use an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction model to estimate the depth and create a large-scale RGB-Depth dataset after a manual data clean-up process. We utilise this dataset to minimise the novel depth consistency loss via adversarial learning (note we do not have ground truth depth maps for generated face images) and the depth categorical loss of synthetic data on the discriminator. In addition, to improve the generalisation and lower the bias of the depth parameters, we propose to use a novel confidence regulariser on the discriminator side of the framework. We extensively performed both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two publicly available challenging facial expression benchmarks: AffectNet and RaFD. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competitive baseline and existing arts by a large margin.      
### 2.Joint Contrastive Learning with Infinite Possibilities  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14776.pdf)
>  This paper explores useful modifications of the recent development in contrastive learning via novel probabilistic modeling. We derive a particular form of contrastive loss named Joint Contrastive Learning (JCL). JCL implicitly involves the simultaneous learning of an infinite number of query-key pairs, which poses tighter constraints when searching for invariant features. We derive an upper bound on this formulation that allows analytical solutions in an end-to-end training manner. While JCL is practically effective in numerous computer vision applications, we also theoretically unveil the certain mechanisms that govern the behavior of JCL. We demonstrate that the proposed formulation harbors an innate agency that strongly favors similarity within each instance-specific class, and therefore remains advantageous when searching for discriminative features among distinct instances. We evaluate these proposals on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating considerable improvements over existing algorithms.

### 3.Attention-Aware Noisy Label Learning for Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14757.pdf)
>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learned on large-scale labeled samples have achieved remarkable progress in computer vision, such as image/video classification. The cheapest way to obtain a large body of labeled visual data is to crawl from websites with user-supplied labels, such as Flickr. However, these samples often tend to contain incorrect labels (i.e. noisy labels), which will significantly degrade the network performance. In this paper, the attention-aware noisy label learning approach ($A^2NL$) is proposed to improve the discriminative capability of the network trained on datasets with potential label noise. Specifically, a Noise-Attention model, which contains multiple noise-specific units, is designed to better capture noisy information. Each unit is expected to learn a specific noisy distribution for a subset of images so that different disturbances are more precisely modeled. Furthermore, a recursive learning process is introduced to strengthen the learning ability of the attention network by taking advantage of the learned high-level knowledge. To fully evaluate the proposed method, we conduct experiments from two aspects: manually flipped label noise on large-scale image classification datasets, including CIFAR-10, SVHN; and real-world label noise on an online crawled clothing dataset with multiple attributes. The superior results over state-of-the-art methods validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.      
### 4.Multi-channel Deep 3D Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14743.pdf)
>  Face recognition has been of great importance in many applications as a biometric for its throughput, convenience, and non-invasiveness. Recent advancements in deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures have boosted significantly the performance of face recognition based on two-dimensional (2D) facial texture images and outperformed the previous state of the art using conventional methods. However, the accuracy of 2D face recognition is still challenged by the change of pose, illumination, make-up, and expression. On the other hand, the geometric information contained in three-dimensional (3D) face data has the potential to overcome the fundamental limitations of 2D face data. <br>We propose a multi-Channel deep 3D face network for face recognition based on 3D face data. We compute the geometric information of a 3D face based on its piecewise-linear triangular mesh structure and then conformally flatten geometric information along with the color from 3D to 2D plane to leverage the state-of-the-art deep CNN architectures. We modify the input layer of the network to take images with nine channels instead of three only such that more geometric information can be explicitly fed to it. We pre-train the network using images from the VGG-Face \cite{Parkhi2015} and then fine-tune it with the generated multi-channel face images. The face recognition accuracy of the multi-Channel deep 3D face network has achieved 98.6. The experimental results also clearly show that the network performs much better when a 9-channel image is flattened to plane based on the conformal map compared with the orthographic projection.      
### 5.Texture-aware Multi-resolution Image Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14721.pdf)
>  Recent GAN-based inpainting methods have shown remarkable performance using multi-stage networks and/or contextual attention modules (CAM). However, these models require heavy computational resources and may fail to restore realistic texture details. This is mainly due to their training approaches and loss functions. Furthermore, GANs are hard to train on high-resolution images leading to unstable models and poor performance. Inspired by these observations, we propose a novel multi-resolution generators architecture allowing stable training and increased performance. Specifically, our training schema optimizes the parameters of four successive generators such that higher resolution generators exploit the inpainted images produced by lower resolution generators. To restore fine-grained textures, we present a new LBP-based loss function that minimizes the difference between the generated and ground truth textures. We conduct our experiments on Places2 and CelebHQ datasets, and we report qualitative and quantitative results against the state-of-the-art methods. Results show that the computationally efficient model achieves competitive performance.      
### 6.Deep Learning-based Pipeline for Module Power Prediction from EL Measurements  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14712.pdf)
>  Automated inspection plays an important role in monitoring large-scale photovoltaic power plants. Commonly, electroluminescense measurements are used to identify various types of defects on solar modules but have not been used to determine the power of a module. However, knowledge of the power at maximum power point is important as well, since drops in the power of a single module can affect the performance of an entire string. By now, this is commonly determined by measurements that require to discontact or even dismount the module, rendering a regular inspection of individual modules infeasible. In this work, we bridge the gap between electroluminescense measurements and the power determination of a module. We compile a large dataset of 719 electroluminescense measurementsof modules at various stages of degradation, especially cell cracks and fractures, and the corresponding power at maximum power point. Here,we focus on inactive regions and cracks as the predominant type of defect. We set up a baseline regression model to predict the power from electroluminescense measurements with a mean absolute error of 9.0+/-3.7W (4.0+/-8.4%). Then, we show that deep-learning can be used to train a model that performs significantly better (7.3+/-2.7W or 3.2+/-6.5%). With this work, we aim to open a new research topic. Therefore, we publicly release the dataset, the code and trained models to empower other researchers to compare against our results. Finally, we present a thorough evaluation of certain boundary conditions like the dataset size and an automated preprocessing pipeline for on-site measurements showing multiple modules at once.      
### 7.Benchmark for Anonymous Video Analytics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14684.pdf)
>  Estimating the number of people exposed to digital signage is important to help measuring the return on investment of digital out-of-home advertisement. However, while audience measurement solutions are of increasing interest, no commonly accepted benchmark exists to evaluate their performance. In this paper, we propose the first benchmark for digital out-of-home audience measurement that evaluates the tasks of audience localization and counting, and audience demographics. The benchmark is composed of a novel video dataset captured in multiple indoor and outdoor locations and a set of performance measures. Using the benchmark, we present an in-depth comparison of eight open-source algorithms on four hardware platforms with GPU and CPU-optimized inferences and of two commercial off-the-shelf solutions for localization, count, age, and gender estimation.      
### 8.SoRC -- Evaluation of Computational Molecular Co-Localization Analysis in Mass Spectrometry Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14677.pdf)
>  The computational analysis of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) data aims at the identification of interesting mass co-localizations and the visualization of their lateral distribution in the sample, usually a tissue cross section. But as the morphological structure of tissues and the different kinds of mass co-localization naturally show a huge diversity, the selection and tuning of the computational method is a time-consuming effort. In this work we address the special problem of computationally grouping mass channel images according to their similarities in their lateral distribution patterns. Such an analysis is driven by the idea, that groups of molecules that feature a similar distribution pattern may have a functional relation. But the selection of the similarity function and other parameters is often done by a time-consuming and unsatsifactory trial and error. We propose a new flexible workflow scheme called SoRC (sum of ranked cluster indices) for automating this tuning step and making it much more efficient. We test SoRC using three different data sets acquired from the lab for three different kinds of samples (barley seed, mouse bladder tissue, human PXE skin). We show, that SORC can be applied to score and visualize the results obtained with the applied methods in short time without too much effort. In our application example, the SoRC results for the three data sets reveal that a) some well-known similarity functions are suited to achieve good results for all three data sets and b) for the MSI data featuring a higher degree of irregularity improved results can be achieved by applying non-standard similarity functions. The SoRC scores computed with our approach indicate that an automated testing and scoring of different methods for mass channel image grouping can improve the final outcome of a study by finally selecting the methods of the highest scores.      
### 9.Encode the Unseen: Predictive Video Hashing for Scalable Mid-Stream Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14661.pdf)
>  This paper tackles a new problem in computer vision: mid-stream video-to-video retrieval. This task, which consists in searching a database for content similar to a video right as it is playing, e.g. from a live stream, exhibits challenging characteristics. Only the beginning part of the video is available as query and new frames are constantly added as the video plays out. To perform retrieval in this demanding situation, we propose an approach based on a binary encoder that is both predictive and incremental in order to (1) account for the missing video content at query time and (2) keep up with repeated, continuously evolving queries throughout the streaming. In particular, we present the first hashing framework that infers the unseen future content of a currently playing video. Experiments on FCVID and ActivityNet demonstrate the feasibility of this task. Our approach also yields a significant mAP@20 performance increase compared to a baseline adapted from the literature for this task, for instance 7.4% (2.6%) increase at 20% (50%) of elapsed runtime on FCVID using bitcodes of size 192 bits.      
### 10.Driver Anomaly Detection: A Dataset and Contrastive Learning Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14660.pdf)
>  Distracted drivers are more likely to fail to anticipate hazards, which result in car accidents. Therefore, detecting anomalies in drivers' actions (i.e., any action deviating from normal driving) contains the utmost importance to reduce driver-related accidents. However, there are unbounded many anomalous actions that a driver can do while driving, which leads to an 'open set recognition' problem. Accordingly, instead of recognizing a set of anomalous actions that are commonly defined by previous dataset providers, in this work, we propose a contrastive learning approach to learn a metric to differentiate normal driving from anomalous driving. For this task, we introduce a new video-based benchmark, the Driver Anomaly Detection (DAD) dataset, which contains normal driving videos together with a set of anomalous actions in its training set. In the test set of the DAD dataset, there are unseen anomalous actions that still need to be winnowed out from normal driving. Our method reaches 0.9673 AUC on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the contrastive learning approach on the anomaly detection task. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available.      
### 11.Dissected 3D CNNs: Temporal Skip Connections for Efficient Online Video Processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14639.pdf)
>  Convolutional Neural Networks with 3D kernels (3D CNNs) currently achieve state-of-the-art results in video recognition tasks due to their supremacy in extracting spatiotemporal features within video frames. There have been many successful 3D CNN architectures surpassing the state-of-the-art results successively. However, nearly all of them are designed to operate offline creating several serious handicaps during online operation. Firstly, conventional 3D CNNs are not dynamic since their output features represent the complete input clip instead of the most recent frame in the clip. Secondly, they are not temporal resolution-preserving due to their inherent temporal downsampling. Lastly, 3D CNNs are constrained to be used with fixed temporal input size limiting their flexibility. In order to address these drawbacks, we propose dissected 3D CNNs, where the intermediate volumes of the network are dissected and propagated over depth (time) dimension for future calculations, substantially reducing the number of computations at online operation. For action classification, the dissected version of ResNet models performs 74-90% fewer computations at online operation while achieving $\sim$5% better classification accuracy on the Kinetics-600 dataset than conventional 3D ResNet models. Moreover, the advantages of dissected 3D CNNs are demonstrated by deploying our approach onto several vision tasks, which consistently improved the performance.      
### 12.Adversarial Semi-Supervised Multi-Domain Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14635.pdf)
>  Neural networks for multi-domain learning empowers an effective combination of information from different domains by sharing and co-learning the parameters. In visual tracking, the emerging features in shared layers of a multi-domain tracker, trained on various sequences, are crucial for tracking in unseen videos. Yet, in a fully shared architecture, some of the emerging features are useful only in a specific domain, reducing the generalization of the learned feature representation. We propose a semi-supervised learning scheme to separate domain-invariant and domain-specific features using adversarial learning, to encourage mutual exclusion between them, and to leverage self-supervised learning for enhancing the shared features using the unlabeled reservoir. By employing these features and training dedicated layers for each sequence, we build a tracker that performs exceptionally on different types of videos.      
### 13.A robustness measure for singular point and index estimation in discretized orientation and vector fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14570.pdf)
>  The identification of singular points or topological defects in discretized vector fields occurs in diverse areas ranging from the polarization of the cosmic microwave background to liquid crystals to fingerprint recognition and bio-medical imaging. Due to their discrete nature, defects and their topological charge cannot depend continuously on each single vector, but they discontinuously change as soon as a vector changes by more than a threshold. Considering this threshold of admissible change at the level of vectors, we develop a robustness measure for discrete defect estimators. Here, we compare different template paths for defect estimation in discretized vector or orientation fields. Sampling prototypical vector field patterns around defects shows that the robustness increases with the length of template path, but less so in the presence of noise on the vectors. We therefore find an optimal trade-off between resolution and robustness against noise for relatively small templates, except for the "single pixel" defect analysis, which cannot exclude zero robustness. The presented robustness measure paves the way for uncertainty quantification of defects in discretized vector fields.      
### 14.Restoring Spatially-Heterogeneous Distortions using Mixture of Experts Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14563.pdf)
>  In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been successfully applied to the image distortion restoration tasks. However, scenarios that assume a single distortion only may not be suitable for many real-world applications. To deal with such cases, some studies have proposed sequentially combined distortions datasets. Viewing in a different point of combining, we introduce a spatially-heterogeneous distortion dataset in which multiple corruptions are applied to the different locations of each image. In addition, we also propose a mixture of experts network to effectively restore a multi-distortion image. Motivated by the multi-task learning, we design our network to have multiple paths that learn both common and distortion-specific representations. Our model is effective for restoring real-world distortions and we experimentally verify that our method outperforms other models designed to manage both single distortion and multiple distortions.      
### 15.Learning Object Detection from Captions via Textual Scene Attributes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14558.pdf)
>  Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, requiring large annotated datasets that are difficult to collect, as annotators need to label objects and their bounding boxes. Thus, it is a significant challenge to use cheaper forms of supervision effectively. Recent work has begun to explore image captions as a source for weak supervision, but to date, in the context of object detection, captions have only been used to infer the categories of the objects in the image. In this work, we argue that captions contain much richer information about the image, including attributes of objects and their relations. Namely, the text represents a scene of the image, as described recently in the literature. We present a method that uses the attributes in this "textual scene graph" to train object detectors. We empirically demonstrate that the resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging object detection datasets, outperforming recent approaches.      
### 16.Demographic Influences on Contemporary Art with Unsupervised Style Embeddings  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14545.pdf)
>  Computational art analysis has, through its reliance on classification tasks, prioritised historical datasets in which the artworks are already well sorted with the necessary annotations. Art produced today, on the other hand, is numerous and easily accessible, through the internet and social networks that are used by professional and amateur artists alike to display their work. Although this art, yet unsorted in terms of style and genre, is less suited for supervised analysis, the data sources come with novel information that may help frame the visual content in equally novel ways. As a first step in this direction, we present contempArt, a multi-modal dataset of exclusively contemporary artworks. contempArt is a collection of paintings and drawings, a detailed graph network based on social connections on Instagram and additional socio-demographic information; all attached to 442 artists at the beginning of their career. We evaluate three methods suited for generating unsupervised style embeddings of images and correlate them with the remaining data. We find no connections between visual style on the one hand and social proximity, gender, and nationality on the other.      
### 17.Asymmetric Contextual Modulation for Infrared Small Target Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14530.pdf)
>  Single-frame infrared small target detection remains a challenge not only due to the scarcity of intrinsic target characteristics but also because of lacking a public dataset. In this paper, we first contribute an open dataset with high-quality annotations to advance the research in this field. We also propose an asymmetric contextual modulation module specially designed for detecting infrared small targets. To better highlight small targets, besides a top-down global contextual feedback, we supplement a bottom-up modulation pathway based on point-wise channel attention for exchanging high-level semantics and subtle low-level details. We report ablation studies and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods, where we find that our approach performs significantly better. Our dataset and code are available online.      
### 18.Monocular Differentiable Rendering for Self-Supervised 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14524.pdf)
>  3D object detection from monocular images is an ill-posed problem due to the projective entanglement of depth and scale. To overcome this ambiguity, we present a novel self-supervised method for textured 3D shape reconstruction and pose estimation of rigid objects with the help of strong shape priors and 2D instance masks. Our method predicts the 3D location and meshes of each object in an image using differentiable rendering and a self-supervised objective derived from a pretrained monocular depth estimation network. We use the KITTI 3D object detection dataset to evaluate the accuracy of the method. Experiments demonstrate that we can effectively use noisy monocular depth and differentiable rendering as an alternative to expensive 3D ground-truth labels or LiDAR information.      
### 19.The Utility of Decorrelating Colour Spaces in Vector Quantised Variational Autoencoders  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14487.pdf)
>  Vector quantised variational autoencoders (VQ-VAE) are characterised by three main components: 1) encoding visual data, 2) assigning $k$ different vectors in the so-called embedding space, and 3) decoding the learnt features. While images are often represented in RGB colour space, the specific organisation of colours in other spaces also offer interesting features, e.g. CIE L*a*b* decorrelates chromaticity into opponent axes. In this article, we propose colour space conversion, a simple quasi-unsupervised task, to enforce a network learning structured representations. To this end, we trained several instances of VQ-VAE whose input is an image in one colour space, and its output in another, e.g. from RGB to CIE L*a*b* (in total five colour spaces were considered). We examined the finite embedding space of trained networks in order to disentangle the colour representation in VQ-VAE models. Our analysis suggests that certain vectors encode hue and others luminance information. We further evaluated the quality of reconstructed images at low-level using pixel-wise colour metrics, and at high-level by inputting them to image classification and scene segmentation networks. We conducted experiments in three benchmark datasets: ImageNet, COCO and CelebA. Our results show, with respect to the baseline network (whose input and output are RGB), colour conversion to decorrelated spaces obtains 1-2 Delta-E lower colour difference and 5-10% higher classification accuracy. We also observed that the learnt embedding space is easier to interpret in colour opponent models.      
### 20.Affect Expression Behaviour Analysis in the Wild using Spatio-Channel Attention and Complementary Context Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14440.pdf)
>  Facial expression recognition(FER) in the wild is crucial for building reliable human-computer interactive systems. However, current FER systems fail to perform well under various natural and un-controlled conditions. This report presents attention based framework used in our submission to expression recognition track of the Affective Behaviour Analysis in-the-wild (ABAW) 2020 competition. Spatial-channel attention net(SCAN) is used to extract local and global attentive features without seeking any information from landmark detectors. SCAN is complemented by a complementary context information(CCI) branch which uses efficient channel attention(ECA) to enhance the relevance of features. The performance of the model is validated on challenging Aff-Wild2 dataset for categorical expression classification.      
### 21.Towards Adaptive Semantic Segmentation by Progressive Feature Refinement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14420.pdf)
>  As one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision, semantic segmentation plays an important role in real world applications. Although numerous deep learning models have made notable progress on several mainstream datasets with the rapid development of convolutional networks, they still encounter various challenges in practical scenarios. Unsupervised adaptive semantic segmentation aims to obtain a robust classifier trained with source domain data, which is able to maintain stable performance when deployed to a target domain with different data distribution. In this paper, we propose an innovative progressive feature refinement framework, along with domain adversarial learning to boost the transferability of segmentation networks. Specifically, we firstly align the multi-stage intermediate feature maps of source and target domain images, and then a domain classifier is adopted to discriminate the segmentation output. As a result, the segmentation models trained with source domain images can be transferred to a target domain without significant performance degradation. Experimental results verify the efficiency of our proposed method compared with state-of-the-art methods.      
### 22.Uncertainty Estimation and Sample Selection for Crowd Counting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14411.pdf)
>  We present a method for image-based crowd counting, one that can predict a crowd density map together with the uncertainty values pertaining to the predicted density map. To obtain prediction uncertainty, we model the crowd density values using Gaussian distributions and develop a convolutional neural network architecture to predict these distributions. A key advantage of our method over existing crowd counting methods is its ability to quantify the uncertainty of its predictions. We illustrate the benefits of knowing the prediction uncertainty by developing a method to reduce the human annotation effort needed to adapt counting networks to a new domain. We present sample selection strategies which make use of the density and uncertainty of predictions from the networks trained on one domain to select the informative images from a target domain of interest to acquire human annotation. We show that our sample selection strategy drastically reduces the amount of labeled data from the target domain needed to adapt a counting network trained on a source domain to the target domain. Empirically, the networks trained on UCF-QNRF dataset can be adapted to surpass the performance of the previous state-of-the-art results on NWPU dataset and Shanghaitech dataset using only 17$\%$ of the labeled training samples from the target domain.      
### 23.Pruning Filter in Filter  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14410.pdf)
>  Pruning has become a very powerful and effective technique to compress and accelerate modern neural networks. Existing pruning methods can be grouped into two categories: filter pruning (FP) and weight pruning (WP). FP wins at hardware compatibility but loses at compression ratio compared with WP. To converge the strength of both methods, we propose to prune the filter in the filter (PFF). Specifically, we treat a filter $F \in \mathbb{R}^{C\times K\times K}$ as $K \times K$ stripes, i.e., $1\times 1$ filters $\in \mathbb{R}^{C}$, then by pruning the stripes instead of the whole filter, PFF achieves finer granularity than traditional FP while being hardware friendly. PFF is implemented by introducing a novel learnable matrix called Filter Skeleton, whose values reflect the optimal shape of each filter. As some rencent work has shown that the pruned architecture is more crucial than the inherited important weights, we argue that the architecture of a single filter, i.e., the Filter Skeleton, also matters. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFF is more effective compared to the previous FP-based methods and achieves the state-of-art pruning ratio on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets without obvious accuracy drop.      
### 24.Bilateral Asymmetry Guided Counterfactual Generating Network for Mammogram Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14406.pdf)
>  Mammogram benign or malignant classification with only image-level labels is challenging due to the absence of lesion annotations. Motivated by the symmetric prior that the lesions on one side of breasts rarely appear in the corresponding areas on the other side, given a diseased image, we can explore a counterfactual problem that how would the features have behaved if there were no lesions in the image, so as to identify the lesion areas. We derive a new theoretical result for counterfactual generation based on the symmetric prior. By building a causal model that entails such a prior for bilateral images, we obtain two optimization goals for counterfactual generation, which can be accomplished via our newly proposed counterfactual generative network. Our proposed model is mainly composed of Generator Adversarial Network and a \emph{prediction feedback mechanism}, they are optimized jointly and prompt each other. Specifically, the former can further improve the classification performance by generating counterfactual features to calculate lesion areas. On the other hand, the latter helps counterfactual generation by the supervision of classification loss. The utility of our method and the effectiveness of each module in our model can be verified by state-of-the-art performance on INBreast and an in-house dataset and ablation studies.      
### 25.Teacher-Critical Training Strategies for Image Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14405.pdf)
>  Existing image captioning models are usually trained by cross-entropy (XE) loss and reinforcement learning (RL), which set ground-truth words as hard targets and force the captioning model to learn from them. However, the widely adopted training strategies suffer from misalignment in XE training and inappropriate reward assignment in RL training. To tackle these problems, we introduce a teacher model that serves as a bridge between the ground-truth caption and the caption model by generating some easier-to-learn word proposals as soft targets. The teacher model is constructed by incorporating the ground-truth image attributes into the baseline caption model. To effectively learn from the teacher model, we propose Teacher-Critical Training Strategies (TCTS) for both XE and RL training to facilitate better learning processes for the caption model. Experimental evaluations of several widely adopted caption models on the benchmark MSCOCO dataset show the proposed TCTS comprehensively enhances most evaluation metrics, especially the Bleu and Rouge-L scores, in both training stages. TCTS is able to achieve to-date the best published single model Bleu-4 and Rouge-L performances of 40.2% and 59.4% on the MSCOCO Karpathy test split. Our codes and pre-trained models will be open-sourced.      
### 26.AttendNets: Tiny Deep Image Recognition Neural Networks for the Edge via Visual Attention Condensers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14385.pdf)
>  While significant advances in deep learning has resulted in state-of-the-art performance across a large number of complex visual perception tasks, the widespread deployment of deep neural networks for TinyML applications involving on-device, low-power image recognition remains a big challenge given the complexity of deep neural networks. In this study, we introduce AttendNets, low-precision, highly compact deep neural networks tailored for on-device image recognition. More specifically, AttendNets possess deep self-attention architectures based on visual attention condensers, which extends on the recently introduced stand-alone attention condensers to improve spatial-channel selective attention. Furthermore, AttendNets have unique machine-designed macroarchitecture and microarchitecture designs achieved via a machine-driven design exploration strategy. Experimental results on ImageNet$_{50}$ benchmark dataset for the task of on-device image recognition showed that AttendNets have significantly lower architectural and computational complexity when compared to several deep neural networks in research literature designed for efficiency while achieving highest accuracies (with the smallest AttendNet achieving $\sim$7.2% higher accuracy, while requiring $\sim$3$\times$ fewer multiply-add operations, $\sim$4.17$\times$ fewer parameters, and $\sim$16.7$\times$ lower weight memory requirements than MobileNet-V1). Based on these promising results, AttendNets illustrate the effectiveness of visual attention condensers as building blocks for enabling various on-device visual perception tasks for TinyML applications.      
### 27.Toward Privacy and Utility Preserving Image Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14376.pdf)
>  Face images are rich data items that are useful and can easily be collected in many applications, such as in 1-to-1 face verification tasks in the domain of security and surveillance systems. Multiple methods have been proposed to protect an individual's privacy by perturbing the images to remove traces of identifiable information, such as gender or race. However, significantly less attention has been given to the problem of protecting images while maintaining optimal task utility. In this paper, we study the novel problem of creating privacy-preserving image representations with respect to a given utility task by proposing a principled framework called the Adversarial Image Anonymizer (AIA). AIA first creates an image representation using a generative model, then enhances the learned image representations using adversarial learning to preserve privacy and utility for a given task. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available data set to demonstrate the effectiveness of AIA as a privacy-preserving mechanism for face images.      
### 28.Finding It at Another Side: A Viewpoint-Adapted Matching Encoder for Change Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14352.pdf)
>  Change Captioning is a task that aims to describe the difference between images with natural language. Most existing methods treat this problem as a difference judgment without the existence of distractors, such as viewpoint changes. However, in practice, viewpoint changes happen often and can overwhelm the semantic difference to be described. In this paper, we propose a novel visual encoder to explicitly distinguish viewpoint changes from semantic changes in the change captioning task. Moreover, we further simulate the attention preference of humans and propose a novel reinforcement learning process to fine-tune the attention directly with language evaluation rewards. Extensive experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in both Spot-the-Diff and CLEVR-Change datasets.      
### 29.Attention-Driven Body Pose Encoding for Human Activity Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14326.pdf)
>  This article proposes a novel attention-based body pose encoding for human activity recognition that presents a enriched representation of body-pose that is learned. The enriched data complements the 3D body joint position data and improves model performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that learns enhanced feature representations from a given sequence of 3D body joints. To achieve this encoding, the approach exploits 1) a spatial stream which encodes the spatial relationship between various body joints at each time point to learn spatial structure involving the spatial distribution of different body joints 2) a temporal stream that learns the temporal variation of individual body joints over the entire sequence duration to present a temporally enhanced representation. Afterwards, these two pose streams are fused with a multi-head attention mechanism. % adapted from neural machine translation. We also capture the contextual information from the RGB video stream using a Inception-ResNet-V2 model combined with a multi-head attention and a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. %Moreover, we whose performance is enhanced through the multi-head attention mechanism. Finally, the RGB video stream is combined with the fused body pose stream to give a novel end-to-end deep model for effective human activity recognition.      
### 30.CrowdMOT: Crowdsourcing Strategies for Tracking Multiple Objects in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14265.pdf)
>  Crowdsourcing is a valuable approach for tracking objects in videos in a more scalable manner than possible with domain experts. However, existing frameworks do not produce high quality results with non-expert crowdworkers, especially for scenarios where objects split. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a crowdsourcing platform called CrowdMOT, and investigate two micro-task design decisions: (1) whether to decompose the task so that each worker is in charge of annotating all objects in a sub-segment of the video versus annotating a single object across the entire video, and (2) whether to show annotations from previous workers to the next individuals working on the task. We conduct experiments on a diversity of videos which show both familiar objects (aka - people) and unfamiliar objects (aka - cells). Our results highlight strategies for efficiently collecting higher quality annotations than observed when using strategies employed by today's state-of-art crowdsourcing system.      
### 31.Lip-reading with Densely Connected Temporal Convolutional Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14233.pdf)
>  In this work, we present the Densely Connected Temporal Convolutional Network (DC-TCN) for lip-reading of isolated words. Although Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) have recently demonstrated great potential in many vision tasks, its receptive fields are not dense enough to model the complex temporal dynamics in lip-reading scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce dense connections into the network to capture more robust temporal features. Moreover, our approach utilises the Squeeze-and-Excitation block, a light-weight attention mechanism, to further enhance the model's classification power. Without bells and whistles, our DC-TCN method has achieved 88.36% accuracy on the Lip Reading in the Wild (LRW) dataset and 43.65% on the LRW-1000 dataset, which has surpassed all the baseline methods and is the new state-of-the-art on both datasets.      
### 32.TorchRadon: Fast Differentiable Routines for Computed Tomography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14788.pdf)
>  This work presents TorchRadon -- an open source CUDA library which contains a set of differentiable routines for solving computed tomography (CT) reconstruction problems. The library is designed to help researchers working on CT problems to combine deep learning and model-based approaches. The package is developed as a PyTorch extension and can be seamlessly integrated into existing deep learning training code. Compared to the existing Astra Toolbox, TorchRadon is up to 125 faster. The operators implemented by TorchRadon allow the computation of gradients using PyTorch backward(), and can therefore be easily inserted inside existing neural networks architectures. Because of its speed and GPU support, TorchRadon can also be effectively used as a fast backend for the implementation of iterative algorithms. This paper presents the main functionalities of the library, compares results with existing libraries and provides examples of usage.      
### 33.Enhanced Standard Compatible Image Compression Framework based on Auxiliary Codec Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14754.pdf)
>  To enhance image compression performance, recent deep neural network-based research can be divided into three categories: a learnable codec, a postprocessing network, and a compact representation network. The learnable codec has been designed for an end-to-end learning beyond the conventional compression modules. The postprocessing network increases the quality of decoded images using an example-based learning. The compact representation network is learned to reduce the capacity of an input image to reduce the bitrate while keeping the quality of the decoded image. However, these approaches are not compatible with the existing codecs or not optimal to increase the coding efficiency. Specifically, it is difficult to achieve optimal learning in the previous studies using the compact representation network, due to the inaccurate consideration of the codecs. In this paper, we propose a novel standard compatible image compression framework based on Auxiliary Codec Networks (ACNs). ACNs are designed to imitate image degradation operations of the existing codec, which delivers more accurate gradients to the compact representation network. Therefore, the compact representation and the postprocessing networks can be learned effectively and optimally. We demonstrate that our proposed framework based on JPEG and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard substantially outperforms existing image compression algorithms in a standard compatible manner.      
### 34.Improving Auto-Augment via Augmentation-Wise Weight Sharing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14737.pdf)
>  The recent progress on automatically searching augmentation policies has boosted the performance substantially for various tasks. A key component of automatic argumentation search is the evaluation process for a particular augmentation policy, which is utilized to return reward and usually runs thousands of times. A plain evaluation process, which includes full model training and validation, would be time-consuming. To achieve efficiency, many choose to sacrifice evaluation reliability for speed. In this paper, we dive into the dynamics of augmented training of the model. This inspires us to design a powerful and efficient proxy task based on the Augmentation-Wise Weight Sharing (AWS) to form a fast yet accurate evaluation process in an elegant way. Comprehensive analysis verifies the superiority of this approach in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The augmentation policies found by our method achieve the best accuracy compared with existing auto-augmentation search methods. On CIFAR-10, we achieve a top-1 error rate of 1.24%, which is currently the best performing single model without extra training data. On ImageNet, we get a top-1 error rate of 20.36% for ResNet-50, which leads to 3.34% absolute error rate reduction over the baseline augmentation.      
### 35.S3K: Self-Supervised Semantic Keypoints for Robotic Manipulation via Multi-View Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14711.pdf)
>  A robot's ability to act is fundamentally constrained by what it can perceive. Many existing approaches to visual representation learning utilize general-purpose training criteria, e.g. image reconstruction, smoothness in latent space, or usefulness for control, or else make use of large datasets annotated with specific features (bounding boxes, segmentations, etc.). However, both approaches often struggle to capture the fine-detail required for precision tasks on specific objects, e.g. grasping and mating a plug and socket. We argue that these difficulties arise from a lack of geometric structure in these models. In this work we advocate semantic 3D keypoints as a visual representation, and present a semi-supervised training objective that can allow instance or category-level keypoints to be trained to 1-5 millimeter-accuracy with minimal supervision. Furthermore, unlike local texture-based approaches, our model integrates contextual information from a large area and is therefore robust to occlusion, noise, and lack of discernible texture. We demonstrate that this ability to locate semantic keypoints enables high level scripting of human understandable behaviours. Finally we show that these keypoints provide a good way to define reward functions for reinforcement learning and are a good representation for training agents.      
### 36.Where Does Trust Break Down? A Quantitative Trust Analysis of Deep Neural Networks via Trust Matrix and Conditional Trust Densities  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14701.pdf)
>  The advances and successes in deep learning in recent years have led to considerable efforts and investments into its widespread ubiquitous adoption for a wide variety of applications, ranging from personal assistants and intelligent navigation to search and product recommendation in e-commerce. With this tremendous rise in deep learning adoption comes questions about the trustworthiness of the deep neural networks that power these applications. Motivated to answer such questions, there has been a very recent interest in trust quantification. In this work, we introduce the concept of trust matrix, a novel trust quantification strategy that leverages the recently introduced question-answer trust metric by Wong et al. to provide deeper, more detailed insights into where trust breaks down for a given deep neural network given a set of questions. More specifically, a trust matrix defines the expected question-answer trust for a given actor-oracle answer scenario, allowing one to quickly spot areas of low trust that needs to be addressed to improve the trustworthiness of a deep neural network. The proposed trust matrix is simple to calculate, humanly interpretable, and to the best of the authors' knowledge is the first to study trust at the actor-oracle answer level. We further extend the concept of trust densities with the notion of conditional trust densities. We experimentally leverage trust matrices to study several well-known deep neural network architectures for image recognition, and further study the trust density and conditional trust densities for an interesting actor-oracle answer scenario. The results illustrate that trust matrices, along with conditional trust densities, can be useful tools in addition to the existing suite of trust quantification metrics for guiding practitioners and regulators in creating and certifying deep learning solutions for trusted operation.      
### 37.COVID-CT-MD: COVID-19 Computed Tomography (CT) Scan Dataset Applicable in Machine Learning and Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14623.pdf)
>  Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has drastically overwhelmed more than 200 countries affecting millions and claiming almost 1 million lives, since its emergence in late 2019. This highly contagious disease can easily spread, and if not controlled in a timely fashion, can rapidly incapacitate healthcare systems. The current standard diagnosis method, the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT- PCR), is time consuming, and subject to low sensitivity. Chest Radiograph (CXR), the first imaging modality to be used, is readily available and gives immediate results. However, it has notoriously lower sensitivity than Computed Tomography (CT), which can be used efficiently to complement other diagnostic methods. This paper introduces a new COVID-19 CT scan dataset, referred to as COVID-CT-MD, consisting of not only COVID-19 cases, but also healthy and subjects infected by Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). COVID-CT-MD dataset, which is accompanied with lobe-level, slice-level and patient-level labels, has the potential to facilitate the COVID-19 research, in particular COVID-CT-MD can assist in development of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) based solutions.      
### 38.FAN: Frequency Aggregation Network for Real Image Super-resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14547.pdf)
>  Single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to recover the high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution (LR) input image. With the development of deep learning, SISR has achieved great progress. However, It is still a challenge to restore the real-world LR image with complicated authentic degradations. Therefore, we propose FAN, a frequency aggregation network, to address the real-world image super-resolu-tion problem. Specifically, we extract different frequencies of the LR image and pass them to a channel attention-grouped residual dense network (CA-GRDB) individually to output corresponding feature maps. And then aggregating these residual dense feature maps adaptively to recover the HR image with enhanced details and textures. We conduct extensive experiments quantitatively and qualitatively to verify that our FAN performs well on the real image super-resolution task of AIM 2020 challenge. According to the released final results, our team SR-IM achieves the fourth place on the X4 track with PSNR of 31.1735 and SSIM of 0.8728.      
### 39.Learning Image-adaptive 3D Lookup Tables for High Performance Photo Enhancement in Real-time  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14468.pdf)
>  Recent years have witnessed the increasing popularity of learning based methods to enhance the color and tone of photos. However, many existing photo enhancement methods either deliver unsatisfactory results or consume too much computational and memory resources, hindering their application to high-resolution images (usually with more than 12 megapixels) in practice. In this paper, we learn image-adaptive 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs) to achieve fast and robust photo enhancement. 3D LUTs are widely used for manipulating color and tone of photos, but they are usually manually tuned and fixed in camera imaging pipeline or photo editing tools. We, for the first time to our best knowledge, propose to learn 3D LUTs from annotated data using pairwise or unpaired learning. More importantly, our learned 3D LUT is image-adaptive for flexible photo enhancement. We learn multiple basis 3D LUTs and a small convolutional neural network (CNN) simultaneously in an end-to-end manner. The small CNN works on the down-sampled version of the input image to predict content-dependent weights to fuse the multiple basis 3D LUTs into an image-adaptive one, which is employed to transform the color and tone of source images efficiently. Our model contains less than 600K parameters and takes less than 2 ms to process an image of 4K resolution using one Titan RTX GPU. While being highly efficient, our model also outperforms the state-of-the-art photo enhancement methods by a large margin in terms of PSNR, SSIM and a color difference metric on two publically available benchmark datasets.      
### 40.Ask-n-Learn: Active Learning via Reliable Gradient Representations for Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14448.pdf)
>  Deep predictive models rely on human supervision in the form of labeled training data. Obtaining large amounts of annotated training data can be expensive and time consuming, and this becomes a critical bottleneck while building such models in practice. In such scenarios, active learning (AL) strategies are used to achieve faster convergence in terms of labeling efforts. Existing active learning employ a variety of heuristics based on uncertainty and diversity to select query samples. Despite their wide-spread use, in practice, their performance is limited by a number of factors including non-calibrated uncertainties, insufficient trade-off between data exploration and exploitation, presence of confirmation bias etc. In order to address these challenges, we propose Ask-n-Learn, an active learning approach based on gradient embeddings obtained using the pesudo-labels estimated in each iteration of the algorithm. More importantly, we advocate the use of prediction calibration to obtain reliable gradient embeddings, and propose a data augmentation strategy to alleviate the effects of confirmation bias during pseudo-labeling. Through empirical studies on benchmark image classification tasks (CIFAR-10, SVHN, Fashion-MNIST, MNIST), we demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, including the recently proposed BADGE algorithm.      
### 41.Efficient Kernel Transfer in Knowledge Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14416.pdf)
>  Knowledge distillation is an effective way for model compression in deep learning. Given a large model (i.e., teacher model), it aims to improve the performance of a compact model (i.e., student model) by transferring the information from the teacher. An essential challenge in knowledge distillation is to identify the appropriate information to transfer. In early works, only the final output of the teacher model is used as the soft label to help the training of student models. Recently, the information from intermediate layers is also adopted for better distillation. In this work, we aim to optimize the process of knowledge distillation from the perspective of kernel matrix. The output of each layer in a neural network can be considered as a new feature space generated by applying a kernel function on original images. Hence, we propose to transfer the corresponding kernel matrix (i.e., Gram matrix) from teacher models to student models for distillation. However, the size of the whole kernel matrix is quadratic to the number of examples. To improve the efficiency, we decompose the original kernel matrix with Nystr{ö}m method and then transfer the partial matrix obtained with landmark points, whose size is linear in the number of examples. More importantly, our theoretical analysis shows that the difference between the original kernel matrices of teacher and student can be well bounded by that of their corresponding partial matrices. Finally, a new strategy of generating appropriate landmark points is proposed for better distillation. The empirical study on benchmark data sets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Code will be released.      
### 42.Geometric Matrix Completion: A Functional View  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14343.pdf)
>  We propose a totally functional view of geometric matrix completion problem. Differently from existing work, we propose a novel regularization inspired from the functional map literature that is more interpretable and theoretically sound. On synthetic tasks with strong underlying geometric structure, our framework outperforms state of the art by a huge margin (two order of magnitude) demonstrating the potential of our approach. On real datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art results at a fraction of the computational effort of previous methods.

### 43.Learning an optimal PSF-pair for ultra-dense 3D localization microscopy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14303.pdf)
>  A long-standing challenge in multiple-particle-tracking is the accurate and precise 3D localization of individual particles at close proximity. One established approach for snapshot 3D imaging is point-spread-function (PSF) engineering, in which the PSF is modified to encode the axial information. However, engineered PSFs are challenging to localize at high densities due to lateral PSF overlaps. Here we suggest using multiple PSFs simultaneously to help overcome this challenge, and investigate the problem of engineering multiple PSFs for dense 3D localization. We implement our approach using a bifurcated optical system that modifies two separate PSFs, and design the PSFs using three different approaches including end-to-end learning. We demonstrate our approach experimentally by volumetric imaging of fluorescently labelled telomeres in cells.      
### 44.Trustworthy Convolutional Neural Networks: A Gradient Penalized-based Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14260.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image classification. Saliency methods are examples of approaches that can be used to interpret CNNs post hoc, identifying the most relevant pixels for a prediction following the gradients flow. Even though CNNs can correctly classify images, the underlying saliency maps could be erroneous in many cases. This can result in skepticism as to the validity of the model or its interpretation. We propose a novel approach for training trustworthy CNNs by penalizing parameter choices that result in inaccurate saliency maps generated during training. We add a penalty term for inaccurate saliency maps produced when the predicted label is correct, a penalty term for accurate saliency maps produced when the predicted label is incorrect, and a regularization term penalizing overly confident saliency maps. Experiments show increased classification performance, user engagement, and trust.      
### 45.Visually-Grounded Planning without Vision: Language Models Infer Detailed Plans from High-level Instructions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14259.pdf)
>  The recently proposed ALFRED challenge task aims for a virtual robotic agent to complete complex multi-step everyday tasks in a virtual home environment from high-level natural language directives, such as "put a hot piece of bread on a plate". Currently, the best-performing models are able to complete less than 5% of these tasks successfully. In this work we focus on modeling the translation problem of converting natural language directives into detailed multi-step sequences of actions that accomplish those goals in the virtual environment. We empirically demonstrate that it is possible to generate gold multi-step plans from language directives alone without any visual input in 26% of unseen cases. When a small amount of visual information is incorporated, namely the starting location in the virtual environment, our best-performing GPT-2 model successfully generates gold command sequences in 58% of cases. Our results suggest that contextualized language models may provide strong visual semantic planning modules for grounded virtual agents.      
### 46.Acceleration of Large Margin Metric Learning for Nearest Neighbor Classification Using Triplet Mining and Stratified Sampling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14244.pdf)
>  Metric learning is one of the techniques in manifold learning with the goal of finding a projection subspace for increasing and decreasing the inter- and intra-class variances, respectively. Some of the metric learning methods are based on triplet learning with anchor-positive-negative triplets. Large margin metric learning for nearest neighbor classification is one of the fundamental methods to do this. Recently, Siamese networks have been introduced with the triplet loss. Many triplet mining methods have been developed for Siamese networks; however, these techniques have not been applied on the triplets of large margin metric learning for nearest neighbor classification. In this work, inspired by the mining methods for Siamese networks, we propose several triplet mining techniques for large margin metric learning. Moreover, a hierarchical approach is proposed, for acceleration and scalability of optimization, where triplets are selected by stratified sampling in hierarchical hyper-spheres. We analyze the proposed methods on three publicly available datasets, i.e., Fisher Iris, ORL faces, and MNIST datasets.
