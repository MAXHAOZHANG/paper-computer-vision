### 1.RelationNet++: Bridging Visual Representations for Object Detection via Transformer Decoder  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15831.pdf)
>  Existing object detection frameworks are usually built on a single format of object/part representation, i.e., anchor/proposal rectangle boxes in RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN, center points in FCOS and RepPoints, and corner points in CornerNet. While these different representations usually drive the frameworks to perform well in different aspects, e.g., better classification or finer localization, it is in general difficult to combine these representations in a single framework to make good use of each strength, due to the heterogeneous or non-grid feature extraction by different representations. This paper presents an attention-based decoder module similar as that in Transformer~\cite{vaswani2017attention} to bridge other representations into a typical object detector built on a single representation format, in an end-to-end fashion. The other representations act as a set of \emph{key} instances to strengthen the main \emph{query} representation features in the vanilla detectors. Novel techniques are proposed towards efficient computation of the decoder module, including a \emph{key sampling} approach and a \emph{shared location embedding} approach. The proposed module is named \emph{bridging visual representations} (BVR). It can perform in-place and we demonstrate its broad effectiveness in bridging other representations into prevalent object detection frameworks, including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, FCOS and ATSS, where about $1.5\sim3.0$ AP improvements are achieved. In particular, we improve a state-of-the-art framework with a strong backbone by about $2.0$ AP, reaching $52.7$ AP on COCO test-dev. The resulting network is named RelationNet++.

### 2.Passport-aware Normalization for Deep Model Protection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15824.pdf)
>  Despite tremendous success in many application scenarios, deep learning faces serious intellectual property (IP) infringement threats. Considering the cost of designing and training a good model, infringements will significantly infringe the interests of the original model owner. Recently, many impressive works have emerged for deep model IP protection. However, they either are vulnerable to ambiguity attacks, or require changes in the target network structure by replacing its original normalization layers and hence cause significant performance drops. To this end, we propose a new passport-aware normalization formulation, which is generally applicable to most existing normalization layers and only needs to add another passport-aware branch for IP protection. This new branch is jointly trained with the target model but discarded in the inference stage. Therefore it causes no structure change in the target model. Only when the model IP is suspected to be stolen by someone, the private passport-aware branch is added back for ownership verification. Through extensive experiments, we verify its effectiveness in both image and 3D point recognition models. It is demonstrated to be robust not only to common attack techniques like fine-tuning and model compression, but also to ambiguity attacks. By further combining it with trigger-set based methods, both black-box and white-box verification can be achieved for enhanced security of deep learning models deployed in real systems.

### 3.Black-Box Optimization of Object Detector Scales  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15823.pdf)
>  Object detectors have improved considerably in the last years by using advanced CNN architectures. However, many detector hyper-parameters are generally manually tuned, or they are used with values set by the detector authors. Automatic Hyper-parameter optimization has not been explored in improving CNN-based object detectors hyper-parameters. In this work, we propose the use of Black-box optimization methods to tune the prior/default box scales in Faster R-CNN and SSD, using Bayesian Optimization, SMAC, and CMA-ES. We show that by tuning the input image size and prior box anchor scale on Faster R-CNN mAP increases by 2% on PASCAL VOC 2007, and by 3% with SSD. On the COCO dataset with SSD there are mAP improvement in the medium and large objects, but mAP decreases by 1% in small objects. We also perform a regression analysis to find the significant hyper-parameters to tune.      
### 4.Cream of the Crop: Distilling Prioritized Paths For One-Shot Neural Architecture Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15821.pdf)
>  One-shot weight sharing methods have recently drawn great attention in neural architecture search due to high efficiency and competitive performance. However, weight sharing across models has an inherent deficiency, i.e., insufficient training of subnetworks in the hypernetwork. To alleviate this problem, we present a simple yet effective architecture distillation method. The central idea is that subnetworks can learn collaboratively and teach each other throughout the training process, aiming to boost the convergence of individual models. We introduce the concept of prioritized path, which refers to the architecture candidates exhibiting superior performance during training. Distilling knowledge from the prioritized paths is able to boost the training of subnetworks. Since the prioritized paths are changed on the fly depending on their performance and complexity, the final obtained paths are the cream of the crop. We directly select the most promising one from the prioritized paths as the final architecture, without using other complex search methods, such as reinforcement learning or evolution algorithms. The experiments on ImageNet verify such path distillation method can improve the convergence ratio and performance of the hypernetwork, as well as boosting the training of subnetworks. The discovered architectures achieve superior performance compared to the recent MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet families under aligned settings. Moreover, the experiments on object detection and more challenging search space show the generality and robustness of the proposed method.

### 5.WaveTransform: Crafting Adversarial Examples via Input Decomposition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15773.pdf)
>  Frequency spectrum has played a significant role in learning unique and discriminating features for object recognition. Both low and high frequency information present in images have been extracted and learnt by a host of representation learning techniques, including deep learning. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel class of adversarial attacks, namely `WaveTransform', that creates adversarial noise corresponding to low-frequency and high-frequency subbands, separately (or in combination). The frequency subbands are analyzed using wavelet decomposition; the subbands are corrupted and then used to construct an adversarial example. Experiments are performed using multiple databases and CNN models to establish the effectiveness of the proposed WaveTransform attack and analyze the importance of a particular frequency component. The robustness of the proposed attack is also evaluated through its transferability and resiliency against a recent adversarial defense algorithm. Experiments show that the proposed attack is effective against the defense algorithm and is also transferable across CNNs.      
### 6.Recurrent Neural Networks for video object detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15740.pdf)
>  There is lots of scientific work about object detection in images. For many applications like for example autonomous driving the actual data on which classification has to be done are videos. This work compares different methods, especially those which use Recurrent Neural Networks to detect objects in videos. We differ between feature-based methods, which feed feature maps of different frames into the recurrent units, box-level methods, which feed bounding boxes with class probabilities into the recurrent units and methods which use flow networks. This study indicates common outcomes of the compared methods like the benefit of including the temporal context into object detection and states conclusions and guidelines for video object detection networks.      
### 7.Permute, Quantize, and Fine-tune: Efficient Compression of Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15703.pdf)
>  Compressing large neural networks is an important step for their deployment in resource-constrained computational platforms. In this context, vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code, and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40 to 70% with respect to the current state of the art.      
### 8.Learning Deep Interleaved Networks with Asymmetric Co-Attention for Image Restoration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15689.pdf)
>  Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated significant success for image restoration (IR) tasks (e.g., image super-resolution, image deblurring, rain streak removal, and dehazing). However, existing CNN based models are commonly implemented as a single-path stream to enrich feature representations from low-quality (LQ) input space for final predictions, which fail to fully incorporate preceding low-level contexts into later high-level features within networks, thereby producing inferior results. In this paper, we present a deep interleaved network (DIN) that learns how information at different states should be combined for high-quality (HQ) images reconstruction. The proposed DIN follows a multi-path and multi-branch pattern allowing multiple interconnected branches to interleave and fuse at different states. In this way, the shallow information can guide deep representative features prediction to enhance the feature expression ability. Furthermore, we propose asymmetric co-attention (AsyCA) which is attached at each interleaved node to model the feature dependencies. Such AsyCA can not only adaptively emphasize the informative features from different states, but also improves the discriminative ability of networks. Our presented DIN can be trained end-to-end and applied to various IR tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed DIN perform favorably against the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 9.Deep DA for Ordinal Regression of Pain Intensity Estimation Using Weakly-Labeled Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15675.pdf)
>  Automatic estimation of pain intensity from facial expressions in videos has an immense potential in health care applications. However, domain adaptation (DA) is needed to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occurs between video data captured in source and target do-mains. Given the laborious task of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL)is gaining attention in such applications. Yet, most state-of-the-art WSL models are typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the ordinal relation between intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new deep learn-ing model for weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression(WSDA-OR), where videos in target domain have coarse la-bels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels as-signed to the target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level labels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and domain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple in-stance learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from the target domain. The proposed approach was validated on the RECOLA video dataset as fully-labeled source domain, and UNBC-McMaster video data as weakly-labeled target domain. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private) datasets for sequence level estimation. Experimental results indicate that our approach can provide a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art models, allowing to achieve a greater localization accuracy.      
### 10.Free-Form Image Inpainting via Contrastive Attention Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15643.pdf)
>  Most deep learning based image inpainting approaches adopt autoencoder or its variants to fill missing regions in images. Encoders are usually utilized to learn powerful representational spaces, which are important for dealing with sophisticated learning tasks. Specifically, in image inpainting tasks, masks with any shapes can appear anywhere in images (i.e., free-form masks) which form complex patterns. It is difficult for encoders to capture such powerful representations under this complex situation. To tackle this problem, we propose a self-supervised Siamese inference network to improve the robustness and generalization. It can encode contextual semantics from full resolution images and obtain more discriminative representations. we further propose a multi-scale decoder with a novel dual attention fusion module (DAF), which can combine both the restored and known regions in a smooth way. This multi-scale architecture is beneficial for decoding discriminative representations learned by encoders into images layer by layer. In this way, unknown regions will be filled naturally from outside to inside. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on multiple datasets, including facial and natural datasets (i.e., Celeb-HQ, Pairs Street View, Places2 and ImageNet), demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-quality inpainting results.      
### 11.An Overview Of 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15614.pdf)
>  Point cloud 3D object detection has recently received major attention and becomes an active research topic in 3D computer vision community. However, recognizing 3D objects in LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is still a challenge due to the complexity of point clouds. Objects such as pedestrians, cyclists, or traffic cones are usually represented by quite sparse points, which makes the detection quite complex using only point cloud. In this project, we propose a framework that uses both RGB and point cloud data to perform multiclass object recognition. We use existing 2D detection models to localize the region of interest (ROI) on the RGB image, followed by a pixel mapping strategy in the point cloud, and finally, lift the initial 2D bounding box to 3D space. We use the recently released nuScenes dataset---a large-scale dataset contains many data formats---to training and evaluate our proposed architecture.      
### 12.Suppressing Mislabeled Data via Grouping and Self-Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15603.pdf)
>  Deep networks achieve excellent results on large-scale clean data but degrade significantly when learning from noisy labels. To suppressing the impact of mislabeled data, this paper proposes a conceptually simple yet efficient training block, termed as Attentive Feature Mixup (AFM), which allows paying more attention to clean samples and less to mislabeled ones via sample interactions in small groups. Specifically, this plug-and-play AFM first leverages a \textit{group-to-attend} module to construct groups and assign attention weights for group-wise samples, and then uses a \textit{mixup} module with the attention weights to interpolate massive noisy-suppressed samples. The AFM has several appealing benefits for noise-robust deep learning. (i) It does not rely on any assumptions and extra clean subset. (ii) With massive interpolations, the ratio of useless samples is reduced dramatically compared to the original noisy ratio. (iii) \pxj{It jointly optimizes the interpolation weights with classifiers, suppressing the influence of mislabeled data via low attention weights. (iv) It partially inherits the vicinal risk minimization of mixup to alleviate over-fitting while improves it by sampling fewer feature-target vectors around mislabeled data from the mixup vicinal distribution.} Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFM yields state-of-the-art results on two challenging real-world noisy datasets: Food101N and Clothing1M. The code will be available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/kaiwang960112/AFM" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 13.An End to End Network Architecture for Fundamental Matrix Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15528.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end network architecture to estimate fundamental matrix directly from stereo images. To establish a complete working pipeline, different deep neural networks in charge of finding correspondences in images, performing outlier rejection and calculating fundamental matrix, are integrated into an end-to-end network architecture. <br>To well train the network and preserve geometry properties of fundamental matrix, a new loss function is introduced. To evaluate the accuracy of estimated fundamental matrix more reasonably, we design a new evaluation metric which is highly consistent with visualization result. Experiments conducted on both outdoor and indoor data-sets show that this network outperforms traditional methods as well as previous deep learning based methods on various metrics and achieves significant performance improvements.      
### 14.Asynchronous Corner Tracking Algorithm based on Lifetime of Events for DAVIS Cameras  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15510.pdf)
>  Event cameras, i.e., the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) ones, capture the intensity changes in the scene and generates a stream of events in an asynchronous fashion. The output rate of such cameras can reach up to 10 million events per second in high dynamic environments. DAVIS cameras use novel vision sensors that mimic human eyes. Their attractive attributes, such as high output rate, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and high pixel bandwidth, make them an ideal solution for applications that require high-frequency tracking. Moreover, applications that operate in challenging lighting scenarios can exploit the high HDR of event cameras, i.e., 140 dB compared to 60 dB of traditional cameras. In this paper, a novel asynchronous corner tracking method is proposed that uses both events and intensity images captured by a DAVIS camera. The Harris algorithm is used to extract features, i.e., frame-corners from keyframes, i.e., intensity images. Afterward, a matching algorithm is used to extract event-corners from the stream of events. Events are solely used to perform asynchronous tracking until the next keyframe is captured. Neighboring events, within a window size of 5x5 pixels around the event-corner, are used to calculate the velocity and direction of extracted event-corners by fitting the 2D planar using a randomized Hough transform algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that our approach is able to update the location of the extracted corners up to 100 times during the blind time of traditional cameras, i.e., between two consecutive intensity images.      
### 15.Night vision obstacle detection and avoidance based on Bio-Inspired Vision Sensors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15509.pdf)
>  Moving towards autonomy, unmanned vehicles rely heavily on state-of-the-art collision avoidance systems (CAS). However, the detection of obstacles especially during night-time is still a challenging task since the lighting conditions are not sufficient for traditional cameras to function properly. Therefore, we exploit the powerful attributes of event-based cameras to perform obstacle detection in low lighting conditions. Event cameras trigger events asynchronously at high output temporal rate with high dynamic range of up to 120 $dB$. The algorithm filters background activity noise and extracts objects using robust Hough transform technique. The depth of each detected object is computed by triangulating 2D features extracted utilising LC-Harris. Finally, asynchronous adaptive collision avoidance (AACA) algorithm is applied for effective avoidance. Qualitative evaluation is compared using event-camera and traditional camera.      
### 16.Dynamic Resource-aware Corner Detection for Bio-inspired Vision Sensors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15507.pdf)
>  Event-based cameras are vision devices that transmit only brightness changes with low latency and ultra-low power consumption. Such characteristics make event-based cameras attractive in the field of localization and object tracking in resource-constrained systems. Since the number of generated events in such cameras is huge, the selection and filtering of the incoming events are beneficial from both increasing the accuracy of the features and reducing the computational load. In this paper, we present an algorithm to detect asynchronous corners from a stream of events in real-time on embedded systems. The algorithm is called the Three Layer Filtering-Harris or TLF-Harris algorithm. The algorithm is based on an events' filtering strategy whose purpose is 1) to increase the accuracy by deliberately eliminating some incoming events, i.e., noise, and 2) to improve the real-time performance of the system, i.e., preserving a constant throughput in terms of input events per second, by discarding unnecessary events with a limited accuracy loss. An approximation of the Harris algorithm, in turn, is used to exploit its high-quality detection capability with a low-complexity implementation to enable seamless real-time performance on embedded computing platforms. The proposed algorithm is capable of selecting the best corner candidate among neighbors and achieves an average execution time savings of 59 % compared with the conventional Harris score. Moreover, our approach outperforms the competing methods, such as eFAST, eHarris, and FA-Harris, in terms of real-time performance, and surpasses Arc* in terms of accuracy.      
### 17.Beyond cross-entropy: learning highly separable feature distributions for robust and accurate classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15487.pdf)
>  Deep learning has shown outstanding performance in several applications including image classification. However, deep classifiers are known to be highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in that a minor perturbation of the input can easily lead to an error. Providing robustness to adversarial attacks is a very challenging task especially in problems involving a large number of classes, as it typically comes at the expense of an accuracy decrease. In this work, we propose the Gaussian class-conditional simplex (GCCS) loss: a novel approach for training deep robust multiclass classifiers that provides adversarial robustness while at the same time achieving or even surpassing the classification accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Differently from other frameworks, the proposed method learns a mapping of the input classes onto target distributions in a latent space such that the classes are linearly separable. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual samples, our objective function pushes the network to produce feature distributions yielding high inter-class separation. The mean values of the distributions are centered on the vertices of a simplex such that each class is at the same distance from every other class. We show that the regularization of the latent space based on our approach yields excellent classification accuracy and inherently provides robustness to multiple adversarial attacks, both targeted and untargeted, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches over challenging datasets.      
### 18.Self-Supervised Video Representation Using Pretext-Contrastive Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15464.pdf)
>  Pretext tasks and contrastive learning have been successful in self-supervised learning for video retrieval and recognition. In this study, we analyze their optimization targets and utilize the hyper-sphere feature space to explore the connections between them, indicating the compatibility and consistency of these two different learning methods. Based on the analysis, we propose a self-supervised training method, referred as Pretext-Contrastive Learning (PCL), to learn video representations. Extensive experiments based on different combinations of pretext task baselines and contrastive losses confirm the strong agreement with their self-supervised learning targets, demonstrating the effectiveness and the generality of PCL. The combination of pretext tasks and contrastive losses showed significant improvements in both video retrieval and recognition over the corresponding baselines. And we can also outperform current state-of-the-art methods in the same manner. Further, our PCL is flexible and can be applied to almost all existing pretext task methods.      
### 19.Collaborative Method for Incremental Learning on Classification and Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15378.pdf)
>  Although well-trained deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance on numerous tasks, they rapidly forget what they have learned as soon as they begin to learn with additional data with the previous data stop being provided. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm, Incremental Class Learning with Attribute Sharing (ICLAS), for incremental class learning with deep neural networks. As one of its component, we also introduce a generative model, incGAN, which can generate images with increased variety compared with the training data. Under challenging environment of data deficiency, ICLAS incrementally trains classification and the generation networks. Since ICLAS trains both networks, our algorithm can perform multiple times of incremental class learning. The experiments on MNIST dataset demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm.      
### 20.Sea-Net: Squeeze-And-Excitation Attention Net For Diabetic Retinopathy Grading  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15344.pdf)
>  Diabetes is one of the most common disease in individuals. \textit{Diabetic retinopathy} (DR) is a complication of diabetes, which could lead to blindness. Automatic DR grading based on retinal images provides a great diagnostic and prognostic value for treatment planning. However, the subtle differences among severity levels make it difficult to capture important features using conventional methods. To alleviate the problems, a new deep learning architecture for robust DR grading is proposed, referred to as SEA-Net, in which, spatial attention and channel attention are alternatively carried out and boosted with each other, improving the classification performance. In addition, a hybrid loss function is proposed to further maximize the inter-class distance and reduce the intra-class variability. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.      
### 21.Identifying safe intersection design through unsupervised feature extraction from satellite imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15343.pdf)
>  The World Health Organization has listed the design of safer intersections as a key intervention to reduce global road trauma. This article presents the first study to systematically analyze the design of all intersections in a large country, based on aerial imagery and deep learning. Approximately 900,000 satellite images were downloaded for all intersections in Australia and customized computer vision techniques emphasized the road infrastructure. A deep autoencoder extracted high-level features, including the intersection's type, size, shape, lane markings, and complexity, which were used to cluster similar designs. An Australian telematics data set linked infrastructure design to driving behaviors captured during 66 million kilometers of driving. This showed more frequent hard acceleration events (per vehicle) at four- than three-way intersections, relatively low hard deceleration frequencies at T-intersections, and consistently low average speeds on roundabouts. Overall, domain-specific feature extraction enabled the identification of infrastructure improvements that could result in safer driving behaviors, potentially reducing road trauma.      
### 22.SAR-NAS: Skeleton-based Action Recognition via Neural Architecture Searching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15336.pdf)
>  This paper presents a study of automatic design of neural network architectures for skeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, we encode a skeleton-based action instance into a tensor and carefully define a set of operations to build two types of network cells: normal cells and reduction cells. The recently developed DARTS (Differentiable Architecture Search) is adopted to search for an effective network architecture that is built upon the two types of cells. All operations are 2D based in order to reduce the overall computation and search space. Experiments on the challenging NTU RGB+D and Kinectics datasets have verified that most of the networks developed to date for skeleton-based action recognition are likely not compact and efficient. The proposed method provides an approach to search for such a compact network that is able to achieve comparative or even better performance than the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 23.Exploring Generative Adversarial Networks for Image-to-Image Translation in STEM Simulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15315.pdf)
>  The use of accurate scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image simulation methods require large computation times that can make their use infeasible for the simulation of many images. Other simulation methods based on linear imaging models, such as the convolution method, are much faster but are too inaccurate to be used in application. In this paper, we explore deep learning models that attempt to translate a STEM image produced by the convolution method to a prediction of the high accuracy multislice image. We then compare our results to those of regression methods. We find that using the deep learning model Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) provides us with the best results and performs at a similar accuracy level to previous regression models on the same dataset. Codes and data for this project can be found in this GitHub repository, <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/uw-cmg/GAN-STEM-Conv2MultiSlice" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 24.Recurrent neural circuits for contour detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15314.pdf)
>  We introduce a deep recurrent neural network architecture that approximates visual cortical circuits. We show that this architecture, which we refer to as the gamma-net, learns to solve contour detection tasks with better sample efficiency than state-of-the-art feedforward networks, while also exhibiting a classic perceptual illusion, known as the orientation-tilt illusion. Correcting this illusion significantly reduces gamma-net contour detection accuracy by driving it to prefer low-level edges over high-level object boundary contours. Overall, our study suggests that the orientation-tilt illusion is a byproduct of neural circuits that help biological visual systems achieve robust and efficient contour detection, and that incorporating these circuits in artificial neural networks can improve computer vision.      
### 25.Automatic joint damage quantification using computer vision and deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15303.pdf)
>  Joint raveled or spalled damage (henceforth called joint damage) can affect the safety and long-term performance of concrete pavements. It is important to assess and quantify the joint damage over time to assist in building action plans for maintenance, predicting maintenance costs, and maximize the concrete pavement service life. A framework for the accurate, autonomous, and rapid quantification of joint damage with a low-cost camera is proposed using a computer vision technique with a deep learning (DL) algorithm. The DL model is employed to train 263 images of sawcuts with joint damage. The trained DL model is used for pixel-wise color-masking joint damage in a series of query 2D images, which are used to reconstruct a 3D image using open-source structure from motion algorithm. Another damage quantification algorithm using a color threshold is applied to detect and compute the surface area of the damage in the 3D reconstructed image. The effectiveness of the framework was validated through inspecting joint damage at four transverse contraction joints in Illinois, USA, including three acceptable joints and one unacceptable joint by visual inspection. The results show the framework achieves 76% recall and 10% error.      
### 26.Point Cloud Attribute Compression via Successive Subspace Graph Transform  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15302.pdf)
>  Inspired by the recently proposed successive subspace learning (SSL) principles, we develop a successive subspace graph transform (SSGT) to address point cloud attribute compression in this work. The octree geometry structure is utilized to partition the point cloud, where every node of the octree represents a point cloud subspace with a certain spatial size. We design a weighted graph with self-loop to describe the subspace and define a graph Fourier transform based on the normalized graph Laplacian. The transforms are applied to large point clouds from the leaf nodes to the root node of the octree recursively, while the represented subspace is expanded from the smallest one to the whole point cloud successively. It is shown by experimental results that the proposed SSGT method offers better R-D performances than the previous Region Adaptive Haar Transform (RAHT) method.      
### 27.Deep Shells: Unsupervised Shape Correspondence with Optimal Transport  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15261.pdf)
>  We propose a novel unsupervised learning approach to 3D shape correspondence that builds a multiscale matching pipeline into a deep neural network. This approach is based on smooth shells, the current state-of-the-art axiomatic correspondence method, which requires an a priori stochastic search over the space of initial poses. Our goal is to replace this costly preprocessing step by directly learning good initializations from the input surfaces. To that end, we systematically derive a fully differentiable, hierarchical matching pipeline from entropy regularized optimal transport. This allows us to combine it with a local feature extractor based on smooth, truncated spectral convolution filters. Finally, we show that the proposed unsupervised method significantly improves over the state-of-the-art on multiple datasets, even in comparison to the most recent supervised methods. Moreover, we demonstrate compelling generalization results by applying our learned filters to examples that significantly deviate from the training set.      
### 28.Object sieving and morphological closing to reduce false detections in wide-area aerial imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15260.pdf)
>  For object detection in wide-area aerial imagery, post-processing is usually needed to reduce false detections. We propose a two-stage post-processing scheme which comprises an area-thresholding sieving process and a morphological closing operation. We use two wide-area aerial videos to compare the performance of five object detection algorithms in the absence and in the presence of our post-processing scheme. The automatic detection results are compared with the ground-truth objects. Several metrics are used for performance comparison.      
### 29.Fusion Models for Improved Visual Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15251.pdf)
>  Visual captioning aims to generate textual descriptions given images. Traditionally, the captioning models are trained on human annotated datasets such as Flickr30k and MS-COCO, which are limited in size and diversity. This limitation hinders the generalization capabilities of these models while also rendering them to often make mistakes. Language models can, however, be trained on vast amounts of freely available unlabelled data and have recently emerged as successful language encoders and coherent text generators. Meanwhile, several unimodal and multimodal fusion techniques have been proven to work well for natural language generation and automatic speech recognition. Building on these recent developments, and with an aim of improving the quality of generated captions, the contribution of our work in this paper is two-fold: First, we propose a generic multimodal model fusion framework for caption generation as well as emendation where we utilize different fusion strategies to integrate a pretrained Auxiliary Language Model (AuxLM) within the traditional encoder-decoder visual captioning frameworks. Next, we employ the same fusion strategies to integrate a pretrained Masked Language Model (MLM), namely BERT, with a visual captioning model, viz. Show, Attend, and Tell, for emending both syntactic and semantic errors in captions. Our caption emendation experiments on three benchmark image captioning datasets, viz. Flickr8k, Flickr30k, and MSCOCO, show improvements over the baseline, indicating the usefulness of our proposed multimodal fusion strategies. Further, we perform a preliminary qualitative analysis on the emended captions and identify error categories based on the type of corrections.

>  We aim to solve semantic video segmentation in autonomous driving, namely road detection in real time video, using techniques discussed in (Shelhamer et al., 2016a). While fully convolutional network gives good result, we show that the speed can be halved while preserving the accuracy. The test dataset being used is KITTI, which consists of real footage from Germany's streets.      
### 31.CNN Profiler on Polar Coordinate Images for Tropical Cyclone Structure Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15158.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in analyzing tropical cyclones (TC) with satellite images in several tasks, such as TC intensity estimation. In contrast, TC structure, which is conventionally described by a few parameters estimated subjectively by meteorology specialists, is still hard to be profiled objectively and routinely. This study applies CNN on satellite images to create the entire TC structure profiles, covering all the structural parameters. By utilizing the meteorological domain knowledge to construct TC wind profiles based on historical structure parameters, we provide valuable labels for training in our newly released benchmark dataset. With such a dataset, we hope to attract more attention to this crucial issue among data scientists. Meanwhile, a baseline is established with a specialized convolutional model operating on polar-coordinates. We discovered that it is more feasible and physically reasonable to extract structural information on polar-coordinates, instead of Cartesian coordinates, according to a TC's rotational and spiral natures. Experimental results on the released benchmark dataset verified the robustness of the proposed model and demonstrated the potential for applying deep learning techniques for this barely developed yet important topic.      
### 32.Panoster: End-to-end Panoptic Segmentation of LiDAR Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15157.pdf)
>  Panoptic segmentation has recently unified semantic and instance segmentation, previously addressed separately, thus taking a step further towards creating more comprehensive and efficient perception systems. In this paper, we present Panoster, a novel proposal-free panoptic segmentation method for point clouds. Unlike previous approaches relying on several steps to group pixels or points into objects, Panoster proposes a simplified framework incorporating a learning-based clustering solution to identify instances. At inference time, this acts as a class-agnostic semantic segmentation, allowing Panoster to be fast, while outperforming prior methods in terms of accuracy. Additionally, we showcase how our approach can be flexibly and effectively applied on diverse existing semantic architectures to deliver panoptic predictions.      
### 33.Understanding the Failure Modes of Out-of-Distribution Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15775.pdf)
>  Empirical studies suggest that machine learning models often rely on features, such as the background, that may be spuriously correlated with the label only during training time, resulting in poor accuracy during test-time. In this work, we identify the fundamental factors that give rise to this behavior, by explaining why models fail this way {\em even} in easy-to-learn tasks where one would expect these models to succeed. In particular, through a theoretical study of gradient-descent-trained linear classifiers on some easy-to-learn tasks, we uncover two complementary failure modes. These modes arise from how spurious correlations induce two kinds of skews in the data: one geometric in nature, and another, statistical in nature. Finally, we construct natural modifications of image classification datasets to understand when these failure modes can arise in practice. We also design experiments to isolate the two failure modes when training modern neural networks on these datasets.      
### 34.Deep Autofocus for Synthetic Aperture Sonar  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15687.pdf)
>  Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) requires precise positional and environmental information to produce well-focused output during the image reconstruction step. However, errors in these measurements are commonly present resulting in defocused imagery. To overcome these issues, an \emph{autofocus} algorithm is employed as a post-processing step after image reconstruction for the purpose of improving image quality using the image content itself. These algorithms are usually iterative and metric-based in that they seek to optimize an image sharpness metric. In this letter, we demonstrate the potential of machine learning, specifically deep learning, to address the autofocus problem. We formulate the problem as a self-supervised, phase error estimation task using a deep network we call Deep Autofocus. Our formulation has the advantages of being non-iterative (and thus fast) and not requiring ground truth focused-defocused images pairs as often required by other deblurring deep learning methods. We compare our technique against a set of common sharpness metrics optimized using gradient descent over a real-world dataset. Our results demonstrate Deep Autofocus can produce imagery that is perceptually as good as benchmark iterative techniques but at a substantially lower computational cost. We conclude that our proposed Deep Autofocus can provide a more favorable cost-quality trade-off than state-of-the-art alternatives with significant potential of future research.      
### 35.Maximum a posteriori signal recovery for optical coherence tomography angiography image generation and denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15682.pdf)
>  Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a novel and clinically promising imaging modality to image retinal and sub-retinal vasculature. Based on repeated optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, intensity changes are observed over time and used to compute OCTA image data. OCTA data are prone to noise and artifacts caused by variations in flow speed and patient movement. We propose a novel iterative maximum a posteriori signal recovery algorithm in order to generate OCTA volumes with reduced noise and increased image quality. This algorithm is based on previous work on probabilistic OCTA signal models and maximum likelihood estimates. Reconstruction results using total variation minimization and wavelet shrinkage for regularization were compared against an OCTA ground truth volume, merged from six co-registered single OCTA volumes. The results show a significant improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity. The presented algorithm brings together OCTA image generation and Bayesian statistics and can be developed into new OCTA image generation and denoising algorithms.      
### 36.Brain Tumor Segmentation Network Using Attention-based Fusion and Spatial Relationship Constraint  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15647.pdf)
>  Delineating the brain tumor from magnetic resonance (MR) images is critical for the treatment of gliomas. However, automatic delineation is challenging due to the complex appearance and ambiguous outlines of tumors. Considering that multi-modal MR images can reflect different tumor biological properties, we develop a novel multi-modal tumor segmentation network (MMTSN) to robustly segment brain tumors based on multi-modal MR images. The MMTSN is composed of three sub-branches and a main branch. Specifically, the sub-branches are used to capture different tumor features from multi-modal images, while in the main branch, we design a spatial-channel fusion block (SCFB) to effectively aggregate multi-modal features. Additionally, inspired by the fact that the spatial relationship between sub-regions of tumor is relatively fixed, e.g., the enhancing tumor is always in the tumor core, we propose a spatial loss to constrain the relationship between different sub-regions of tumor. We evaluate our method on the test set of multi-modal brain tumor segmentation challenge 2020 (BraTs2020). The method achieves 0.8764, 0.8243 and 0.773 dice score for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.      
### 37.Genetic U-Net: Automatically Designing Lightweight U-shaped CNN Architectures Using the Genetic Algorithm for Retinal Vessel Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15560.pdf)
>  Many previous works based on deep learning for retinal vessel segmentation have achieved promising performance by manually designing U-shaped convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the manual design of these CNNs is time-consuming and requires extensive empirical knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a novel method using genetic algorithms (GAs) to automatically design a lightweight U-shaped CNN for retinal vessel segmentation, called Genetic U-Net. Here we first design a special search space containing the structure of U-Net and its corresponding operations, and then use genetic algorithm to search for superior architectures in this search space. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods on three public datasets, DRIVE, CHASE_DB1 and STARE. In addition, the architectures obtained by the proposed method are more lightweight but robust than the state-of-the-art models.      
### 38.A comparison of automatic multi-tissue segmentation methods of the human fetal brain using the FeTA Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15526.pdf)
>  It is critical to quantitatively analyse the developing human fetal brain in order to fully understand neurodevelopment in both normal fetuses and those with congenital disorders. To facilitate this analysis, automatic multi-tissue fetal brain segmentation algorithms are needed, which in turn requires open databases of segmented fetal brains. Here we introduce a publicly available database of 50 manually segmented pathological and non-pathological fetal magnetic resonance brain volume reconstructions across a range of gestational ages (20 to 33 weeks) into 7 different tissue categories (external cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter, white matter, ventricles, cerebellum, deep grey matter, brainstem/spinal cord). In addition, we quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of several automatic multi-tissue segmentation algorithms of the developing human fetal brain. Four research groups participated, submitting a total of 10 algorithms, demonstrating the benefits the database for the development of automatic algorithms.      
### 39.A Novel Fast 3D Single Image Super-Resolution Algorithm  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15491.pdf)
>  This paper introduces a novel computationally efficient method of solving the 3D single image super-resolution (SR) problem, i.e., reconstruction of a high-resolution volume from its low-resolution counterpart. The main contribution lies in the original way of handling simultaneously the associated decimation and blurring operators, based on their underlying properties in the frequency domain. In particular, the proposed decomposition technique of the 3D decimation operator allows a straightforward implementation for Tikhonov regularization, and can be further used to take into consideration other regularization functions such as the total variation, enabling the computational cost of state-of-the-art algorithms to be considerably decreased. Numerical experiments carried out showed that the proposed approach outperforms existing 3D SR methods.      
### 40.FlatNet: Towards Photorealistic Scene Reconstruction from Lensless Measurements  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15440.pdf)
>  Lensless imaging has emerged as a potential solution towards realizing ultra-miniature cameras by eschewing the bulky lens in a traditional camera. Without a focusing lens, the lensless cameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed measurements. However, the current iterative-optimization-based reconstruction algorithms produce noisier and perceptually poorer images. In this work, we propose a non-iterative deep learning based reconstruction approach that results in orders of magnitude improvement in image quality for lensless reconstructions. Our approach, called $\textit{FlatNet}$, lays down a framework for reconstructing high-quality photorealistic images from mask-based lensless cameras, where the camera's forward model formulation is known. FlatNet consists of two stages: (1) an inversion stage that maps the measurement into a space of intermediate reconstruction by learning parameters within the forward model formulation, and (2) a perceptual enhancement stage that improves the perceptual quality of this intermediate reconstruction. These stages are trained together in an end-to-end manner. We show high-quality reconstructions by performing extensive experiments on real and challenging scenes using two different types of lensless prototypes: one which uses a separable forward model and another, which uses a more general non-separable cropped-convolution model. Our end-to-end approach is fast, produces photorealistic reconstructions, and is easy to adopt for other mask-based lensless cameras.      
### 41.ProCAN: Progressive Growing Channel Attentive Non-Local Network for Lung Nodule Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15417.pdf)
>  Lung cancer classification in screening computed tomography (CT) scans is one of the most crucial tasks for early detection of this disease. Many lives can be saved if we are able to accurately classify malignant/ cancerous lung nodules. Consequently, several deep learning based models have been proposed recently to classify lung nodules as malignant or benign. Nevertheless, the large variation in the size and heterogeneous appearance of the nodules makes this task an extremely challenging one. We propose a new Progressive Growing Channel Attentive Non-Local (ProCAN) network for lung nodule classification. The proposed method addresses this challenge from three different aspects. First, we enrich the Non-Local network by adding channel-wise attention capability to it. Second, we apply Curriculum Learning principles, whereby we first train our model on easy examples before hard/ difficult ones. Third, as the classification task gets harder during the Curriculum learning, our model is progressively grown to increase its capability of handling the task at hand. We examined our proposed method on two different public datasets and compared its performance with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. The results show that the ProCAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves an AUC of 98.05% and accuracy of 95.28% on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Moreover, we conducted extensive ablation studies to analyze the contribution and effects of each new component of our proposed method.      
### 42.Measuring and Harnessing Transference in Multi-Task Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15413.pdf)
>  Multi-task learning can leverage information learned by one task to benefit the training of other tasks. Despite this capacity, naïve formulations often degrade performance and in particular, identifying the tasks that would benefit from co-training remains a challenging design question. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of information transfer, or transference, across tasks throughout training. Specifically, we develop a similarity measure that can quantify transference among tasks and use this quantity to both better understand the optimization dynamics of multi-task learning as well as improve overall learning performance. In the latter case, we propose two methods to leverage our transference metric. The first operates at a macro-level by selecting which tasks should train together while the second functions at a micro-level by determining how to combine task gradients at each training step. We find these methods can lead to significant improvement over prior work on three supervised multi-task learning benchmarks and one multi-task reinforcement learning paradigm.      
### 43.Financial ticket intelligent recognition system based on deep learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15356.pdf)
>  Facing the rapid growth in the issuance of financial tickets (or bills, invoices etc.), traditional manual invoice reimbursement and financial accounting system are imposing an increasing burden on financial accountants and consuming excessive manpower. To solve this problem, we proposes an iterative self-learning Framework of Financial Ticket intelligent Recognition System (FFTRS), which can support the fast iterative updating and extensibility of the algorithm model, which are the fundamental requirements for a practical financial accounting system. In addition, we designed a simple yet efficient Financial Ticket Faster Detection network (FTFDNet) and an intelligent data warehouse of financial ticket are designed to strengthen its efficiency and performance. At present, the system can recognize 194 kinds of financial tickets and has an automatic iterative optimization mechanism, which means, with the increase of application time, the types of tickets supported by the system will continue to increase, and the accuracy of recognition will continue to improve. Experimental results show that the average recognition accuracy of the system is 97.07%, and the average running time for a single ticket is 175.67ms. The practical value of the system has been tested in a commercial application, which makes a beneficial attempt for the deep learning technology in financial accounting work.      
### 44.An automated and multi-parametric algorithm for objective analysis of meibography images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15352.pdf)
>  Meibography is a non-contact imaging technique used by ophthalmologists to assist in the evaluation and diagnosis of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). While artificial qualitative analysis of meibography images could lead to low repeatability and efficiency and multi-parametric analysis is demanding to offer more comprehensive information in discovering subtle changes of meibomian glands during MGD progression, we developed an automated and multi-parametric algorithm for objective and quantitative analysis of meibography images. The full architecture of the algorithm can be divided into three steps: (1) segmentation of the tarsal conjunctiva area as the region of interest (ROI); (2) segmentation and identification of glands within the ROI; and (3) quantitative multi-parametric analysis including newly defined gland diameter deformation index (DI), gland tortuosity index (TI), and glands signal index (SI). To evaluate the performance of the automated algorithm, the similarity index (k) and the segmentation error including the false positive rate (r_P) and the false negative rate (r_N) are calculated between the manually defined ground truth and the automatic segmentations of both the ROI and meibomian glands of 15 typical meibography images. The feasibility of the algorithm is demonstrated in analyzing typical meibograhy images.      
### 45.Speech-Image Semantic Alignment Does Not Depend on Any Prior Classification Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15288.pdf)
>  Semantically-aligned $(speech, image)$ datasets can be used to explore "visually-grounded speech". In a majority of existing investigations, features of an image signal are extracted using neural networks "pre-trained" on other tasks (e.g., classification on ImageNet). In still others, pre-trained networks are used to extract audio features prior to semantic embedding. Without "transfer learning" through pre-trained initialization or pre-trained feature extraction, previous results have tended to show low rates of recall in $speech \rightarrow image$ and $image \rightarrow speech$ queries. <br>Choosing appropriate neural architectures for encoders in the speech and image branches and using large datasets, one can obtain competitive recall rates without any reliance on any pre-trained initialization or feature extraction: $(speech,image)$ semantic alignment and $speech \rightarrow image$ and $image \rightarrow speech$ retrieval are canonical tasks worthy of independent investigation of their own and allow one to explore other questions---e.g., the size of the audio embedder can be reduced significantly with little loss of recall rates in $speech \rightarrow image$ and $image \rightarrow speech$ queries.      
### 46.Class-incremental learning: survey and performance evaluation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15277.pdf)
>  For future learning systems incremental learning is desirable, because it allows for: efficient resource usage by eliminating the need to retrain from scratch at the arrival of new data; reduced memory usage by preventing or limiting the amount of data required to be stored -- also important when privacy limitations are imposed; and learning that more closely resembles human learning. The main challenge for incremental learning is catastrophic forgetting, which refers to the precipitous drop in performance on previously learned tasks after learning a new one. Incremental learning of deep neural networks has seen explosive growth in recent years. Initial work focused on task incremental learning, where a task-ID is provided at inference time. Recently we have seen a shift towards class-incremental learning where the learner must classify at inference time between all classes seen in previous tasks without recourse to a task-ID. In this paper, we provide a complete survey of existing methods for incremental learning, and in particular we perform an extensive experimental evaluation on twelve class-incremental methods. We consider several new experimental scenarios, including a comparison of class-incremental methods on multiple large-scale datasets, investigation into small and large domain shifts, and comparison on various network architectures.      
### 47.GloFlow: Global Image Alignment for Creation of Whole Slide Images for Pathology from Video  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15269.pdf)
>  The application of deep learning to pathology assumes the existence of digital whole slide images of pathology slides. However, slide digitization is bottlenecked by the high cost of precise motor stages in slide scanners that are needed for position information used for slide stitching. We propose GloFlow, a two-stage method for creating a whole slide image using optical flow-based image registration with global alignment using a computationally tractable graph-pruning approach. In the first stage, we train an optical flow predictor to predict pairwise translations between successive video frames to approximate a stitch. In the second stage, this approximate stitch is used to create a neighborhood graph to produce a corrected stitch. On a simulated dataset of video scans of WSIs, we find that our method outperforms known approaches to slide-stitching, and stitches WSIs resembling those produced by slide scanners.      
### 48.Accurate Prostate Cancer Detection and Segmentation on Biparametric MRI using Non-local Mask R-CNN with Histopathological Ground Truth  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15233.pdf)
>  Purpose: We aimed to develop deep machine learning (DL) models to improve the detection and segmentation of intraprostatic lesions (IL) on bp-MRI by using whole amount prostatectomy specimen-based delineations. We also aimed to investigate whether transfer learning and self-training would improve results with small amount labelled data. <br>Methods: 158 patients had suspicious lesions delineated on MRI based on bp-MRI, 64 patients had ILs delineated on MRI based on whole mount prostatectomy specimen sections, 40 patients were unlabelled. A non-local Mask R-CNN was proposed to improve the segmentation accuracy. Transfer learning was investigated by fine-tuning a model trained using MRI-based delineations with prostatectomy-based delineations. Two label selection strategies were investigated in self-training. The performance of models was evaluated by 3D detection rate, dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95 percentile Hausdrauff (95 HD, mm) and true positive ratio (TPR). <br>Results: With prostatectomy-based delineations, the non-local Mask R-CNN with fine-tuning and self-training significantly improved all evaluation metrics. For the model with the highest detection rate and DSC, 80.5% (33/41) of lesions in all Gleason Grade Groups (GGG) were detected with DSC of 0.548[0.165], 95 HD of 5.72[3.17] and TPR of 0.613[0.193]. Among them, 94.7% (18/19) of lesions with GGG &gt; 2 were detected with DSC of 0.604[0.135], 95 HD of 6.26[3.44] and TPR of 0.580[0.190]. <br>Conclusion: DL models can achieve high prostate cancer detection and segmentation accuracy on bp-MRI based on annotations from histologic images. To further improve the performance, more data with annotations of both MRI and whole amount prostatectomy specimens are required.      
### 49.Ground Roll Suppression using Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15209.pdf)
>  Seismic data processing plays a major role in seismic exploration as it conditions much of the seismic interpretation performance. In this context, generating reliable post-stack seismic data depends also on disposing of an efficient pre-stack noise attenuation tool. Here we tackle ground roll noise, one of the most challenging and common noises observed in pre-stack seismic data. Since ground roll is characterized by relative low frequencies and high amplitudes, most commonly used approaches for its suppression are based on frequency-amplitude filters for ground roll characteristic bands. However, when signal and noise share the same frequency ranges, these methods usually deliver also signal suppression or residual noise. In this paper we take advantage of the highly non-linear features of convolutional neural networks, and propose to use different architectures to detect ground roll in shot gathers and ultimately to suppress them using conditional generative adversarial networks. Additionally, we propose metrics to evaluate ground roll suppression, and report strong results compared to expert filtering. Finally, we discuss generalization of trained models for similar and different geologies to better understand the feasibility of our proposal in real applications.
