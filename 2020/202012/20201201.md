### 1.Animating Pictures with Eulerian Motion Fields  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15128.pdf)
>  In this paper, we demonstrate a fully automatic method for converting a still image into a realistic animated looping video. We target scenes with continuous fluid motion, such as flowing water and billowing smoke. Our method relies on the observation that this type of natural motion can be convincingly reproduced from a static Eulerian motion description, i.e. a single, temporally constant flow field that defines the immediate motion of a particle at a given 2D location. We use an image-to-image translation network to encode motion priors of natural scenes collected from online videos, so that for a new photo, we can synthesize a corresponding motion field. The image is then animated using the generated motion through a deep warping technique: pixels are encoded as deep features, those features are warped via Eulerian motion, and the resulting warped feature maps are decoded as images. In order to produce continuous, seamlessly looping video textures, we propose a novel video looping technique that flows features both forward and backward in time and then blends the results. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method by applying it to a large collection of examples including beaches, waterfalls, and flowing rivers.      
### 2.One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking-Head Synthesis for Video Conferencing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15126.pdf)
>  We propose a neural talking-head video synthesis model and demonstrate its application to video conferencing. Our model learns to synthesize a talking-head video using a source image containing the target person's appearance and a driving video that dictates the motion in the output. Our motion is encoded based on a novel keypoint representation, where the identity-specific and motion-related information is decomposed unsupervisedly. Extensive experimental validation shows that our model outperforms competing methods on benchmark datasets. Moreover, our compact keypoint representation enables a video conferencing system that achieves the same visual quality as the commercial H.264 standard while only using one-tenth of the bandwidth. Besides, we show our keypoint representation allows the user to rotate the head during synthesis, which is useful for simulating a face-to-face video conferencing experience.      
### 3.Automating Artifact Detection in Video Games  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15103.pdf)
>  In spite of advances in gaming hardware and software, gameplay is often tainted with graphics errors, glitches, and screen artifacts. This proof of concept study presents a machine learning approach for automated detection of graphics corruptions in video games. Based on a sample of representative screen corruption examples, the model was able to identify 10 of the most commonly occurring screen artifacts with reasonable accuracy. Feature representation of the data included discrete Fourier transforms, histograms of oriented gradients, and graph Laplacians. Various combinations of these features were used to train machine learning models that identify individual classes of graphics corruptions and that later were assembled into a single mixed experts "ensemble" classifier. The ensemble classifier was tested on heldout test sets, and produced an accuracy of 84% on the games it had seen before, and 69% on games it had never seen before.      
### 4.Diverse Sampling for Normalizing Flow Based Trajectory Forecasting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15084.pdf)
>  For autonomous cars to drive safely and effectively, they must anticipate the stochastic future trajectories of other agents in the scene, such as pedestrians and other cars. Forecasting such complex multi-modal distributions requires powerful probabilistic approaches. Normalizing flows have recently emerged as an attractive tool to model such distributions. However, when generating trajectory predictions from a flow model, a key drawback is that independent samples often do not adequately capture all the modes in the underlying distribution. We propose Diversity Sampling for Flow (DSF), a method for improving the quality and the diversity of trajectory samples from a pre-trained flow model. Rather than producing individual samples, DSF produces a set of trajectories in one shot. Given a pre-trained forecasting flow model, we train DSF using gradients from the model, to optimize an objective function that rewards high likelihood for individual trajectories in the predicted set, together with high spatial separation between trajectories. DSF is easy to implement, and we show that it offers a simple plug-in improvement for several existing flow-based forecasting models, achieving state-of-art results on two challenging vehicle and pedestrian forecasting benchmarks.      
### 5.DEF: Deep Estimation of Sharp Geometric Features in 3D Shapes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15081.pdf)
>  Sharp feature lines carry essential information about human-made objects, enabling compact 3D shape representations, high-quality surface reconstruction, and are a signal source for mesh processing. While extracting high-quality lines from noisy and undersampled data is challenging for traditional methods, deep learning-powered algorithms can leverage global and semantic information from the training data to aid in the process. We propose Deep Estimators of Features (DEFs), a learning-based framework for predicting sharp geometric features in sampled 3D shapes. Differently from existing data-driven methods, which reduce this problem to feature classification, we propose to regress a scalar field representing the distance from point samples to the closest feature line on local patches. By fusing the result of individual patches, we can process large 3D models, which are impossible to process for existing data-driven methods due to their size and complexity. Extensive experimental evaluation of DEFs is implemented on synthetic and real-world 3D shape datasets and suggests advantages of our image- and point-based estimators over competitor methods, as well as improved noise robustness and scalability of our approach.      
### 6.Forecasting Characteristic 3D Poses of Human Actions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15079.pdf)
>  We propose the task of forecasting characteristic 3D poses: from a single pose observation of a person, to predict a future 3D pose of that person in a likely action-defining, characteristic pose - for instance, from observing a person picking up a banana, predict the pose of the person eating the banana. Prior work on human motion prediction estimates future poses at fixed time intervals. Although easy to define, this frame-by-frame formulation confounds temporal and intentional aspects of human action. Instead, we define a goal-directed pose prediction task that decouples pose prediction from time, taking inspiration from human, goal-directed behavior. To predict characteristic goal poses, we propose a probabilistic approach that first models the possible multi-modality in the distribution of possible characteristic poses. It then samples future pose hypotheses from the predicted distribution in an autoregressive fashion to model dependencies between joints and then optimizes the final pose with bone length and angle constraints. To evaluate our method, we construct a dataset of manually annotated single-frame observations and characteristic 3D poses. Our experiments with this dataset suggest that our proposed probabilistic approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 22% on average.      
### 7.Fast, Self Supervised, Fully Convolutional Color Normalization of H&amp;E Stained Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15000.pdf)
>  Performance of deep learning algorithms decreases drastically if the data distributions of the training and testing sets are different. Due to variations in staining protocols, reagent brands, and habits of technicians, color variation in digital histopathology images is quite common. Color variation causes problems for the deployment of deep learning-based solutions for automatic diagnosis system in histopathology. Previously proposed color normalization methods consider a small patch as a reference for normalization, which creates artifacts on out-of-distribution source images. These methods are also slow as most of the computation is performed on CPUs instead of the GPUs. We propose a color normalization technique, which is fast during its self-supervised training as well as inference. Our method is based on a lightweight fully-convolutional neural network and can be easily attached to a deep learning-based pipeline as a pre-processing block. For classification and segmentation tasks on CAMELYON17 and MoNuSeg datasets respectively, the proposed method is faster and gives a greater increase in accuracy than the state of the art methods.      
### 8.Guided Adversarial Attack for Evaluating and Enhancing Adversarial Defenses  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14969.pdf)
>  Advances in the development of adversarial attacks have been fundamental to the progress of adversarial defense research. Efficient and effective attacks are crucial for reliable evaluation of defenses, and also for developing robust models. Adversarial attacks are often generated by maximizing standard losses such as the cross-entropy loss or maximum-margin loss within a constraint set using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD). In this work, we introduce a relaxation term to the standard loss, that finds more suitable gradient-directions, increases attack efficacy and leads to more efficient adversarial training. We propose Guided Adversarial Margin Attack (GAMA), which utilizes function mapping of the clean image to guide the generation of adversaries, thereby resulting in stronger attacks. We evaluate our attack against multiple defenses and show improved performance when compared to existing attacks. Further, we propose Guided Adversarial Training (GAT), which achieves state-of-the-art performance amongst single-step defenses by utilizing the proposed relaxation term for both attack generation and training.      
### 9.Deep Dose Plugin Towards Real-time Monte Carlo Dose Calculation Through a Deep Learning based Denoising Algorithm  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14959.pdf)
>  Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is considered the gold standard method for radiotherapy dose calculation. However, achieving high precision requires a large number of simulation histories, which is time consuming. The use of computer graphics processing units (GPUs) has greatly accelerated MC simulation and allows dose calculation within a few minutes for a typical radiotherapy treatment plan. However, some clinical applications demand real time efficiency for MC dose calculation. To tackle this problem, we have developed a real time, deep learning based dose denoiser that can be plugged into a current GPU based MC dose engine to enable real time MC dose calculation. We used two different acceleration strategies to achieve this goal: 1) we applied voxel unshuffle and voxel shuffle operators to decrease the input and output sizes without any information loss, and 2) we decoupled the 3D volumetric convolution into a 2D axial convolution and a 1D slice convolution. In addition, we used a weakly supervised learning framework to train the network, which greatly reduces the size of the required training dataset and thus enables fast fine tuning based adaptation of the trained model to different radiation beams. Experimental results show that the proposed denoiser can run in as little as 39 ms, which is around 11.6 times faster than the baseline model. As a result, the whole MC dose calculation pipeline can be finished within 0.15 seconds, including both GPU MC dose calculation and deep learning based denoising, achieving the real time efficiency needed for some radiotherapy applications, such as online adaptive radiotherapy.      
### 10.Flood Detection via Twitter Streams using Textual and Visual Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14944.pdf)
>  The paper presents our proposed solutions for the MediaEval 2020 Flood-Related Multimedia Task, which aims to analyze and detect flooding events in multimedia content shared over Twitter. In total, we proposed four different solutions including a multi-modal solution combining textual and visual information for the mandatory run, and three single modal image and text-based solutions as optional runs. In the multimodal method, we rely on a supervised multimodal bitransformer model that combines textual and visual features in an early fusion, achieving a micro F1-score of .859 on the development data set. For the text-based flood events detection, we use a transformer network (i.e., pretrained Italian BERT model) achieving an F1-score of .853. For image-based solutions, we employed multiple deep models, pre-trained on both, the ImageNet and places data sets, individually and combined in an early fusion achieving F1-scores of .816 and .805 on the development set, respectively.      
### 11.Floods Detection in Twitter Text and Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14943.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present our methods for the MediaEval 2020 Flood Related Multimedia task, which aims to analyze and combine textual and visual content from social media for the detection of real-world flooding events. The task mainly focuses on identifying floods related tweets relevant to a specific area. We propose several schemes to address the challenge. For text-based flood events detection, we use three different methods, relying on Bog of Words (BOW) and an Italian Version of Bert individually and in combination, achieving an F1-score of 0.77%, 0.68%, and 0.70% on the development set, respectively. For the visual analysis, we rely on features extracted via multiple state-of-the-art deep models pre-trained on ImageNet. The extracted features are then used to train multiple individual classifiers whose scores are then combined in a late fusion manner achieving an F1-score of 0.75%. For our mandatory multi-modal run, we combine the classification scores obtained with the best textual and visual schemes in a late fusion manner. Overall, better results are obtained with the multimodal scheme achieving an F1-score of 0.80% on the development set.      
### 12.Rethinking and Designing a High-performing Automatic License Plate Recognition Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14936.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a real-time and accurate automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) approach. Our study illustrates the outstanding design of ALPR with four insights: (1) the resampling-based cascaded framework is beneficial to both speed and accuracy; (2) the highly efficient license plate recognition should abundant additional character segmentation and recurrent neural network (RNN), but adopt a plain convolutional neural network (CNN); (3) in the case of CNN, taking advantage of vertex information on license plates improves the recognition performance; and (4) the weight-sharing character classifier addresses the lack of training images in small-scale datasets. Based on these insights, we propose a novel ALPR approach, termed VSNet. Specifically, VSNet includes two CNNs, i.e., VertexNet for license plate detection and SCR-Net for license plate recognition, which is integrated in a resampling-based cascaded manner. In VertexNet, we propose an efficient integration block to extract the spatial features of license plates. With vertex supervisory information, we propose a vertex-estimation branch in VertexNet such that license plates can be rectified as the input images of SCR-Net. Moreover, vertex-based data augmentation is employed to diverse the training samples. In SCR-Net, we propose a horizontal encoding technique for left-to-right feature extraction and a weight-sharing classifier for character recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed VSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by more than 50% relative improvement on error rate, achieving &gt;99% recognition accuracy on both CCPD and AOLP datasets with 149 FPS inference speed.      
### 13.Driver Behavior Extraction from Videos in Naturalistic Driving Datasets with 3D ConvNets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14922.pdf)
>  Naturalistic driving data (NDD) is an important source of information to understand crash causation and human factors and to further develop crash avoidance countermeasures. Videos recorded while driving are often included in such datasets. While there is often a large amount of video data in NDD, only a small portion of them can be annotated by human coders and used for research, which underuses all video data. In this paper, we explored a computer vision method to automatically extract the information we need from videos. More specifically, we developed a 3D ConvNet algorithm to automatically extract cell-phone-related behaviors from videos. The experiments show that our method can extract chunks from videos, most of which (~79%) contain the automatically labeled cell phone behaviors. In conjunction with human review of the extracted chunks, this approach can find cell-phone-related driver behaviors much more efficiently than simply viewing video.      
### 14.Trajformer: Trajectory Prediction with Local Self-Attentive Contexts for Autonomous Driving  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14910.pdf)
>  Effective feature-extraction is critical to models' contextual understanding, particularly for applications to robotics and autonomous driving, such as multimodal trajectory prediction. However, state-of-the-art generative methods face limitations in representing the scene context, leading to predictions of inadmissible futures. We alleviate these limitations through the use of self-attention, which enables better control over representing the agent's social context; we propose a local feature-extraction pipeline that produces more salient information downstream, with improved parameter efficiency. We show improvements on standard metrics (minADE, minFDE, DAO, DAC) over various baselines on the Argoverse dataset. We release our code at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Manojbhat09/Trajformer" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 15.Person Perception Biases Exposed: Revisiting the First Impressions Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14906.pdf)
>  This work revisits the ChaLearn First Impressions database, annotated for personality perception using pairwise comparisons via crowdsourcing. We analyse for the first time the original pairwise annotations, and reveal existing person perception biases associated to perceived attributes like gender, ethnicity, age and face attractiveness. We show how person perception bias can influence data labelling of a subjective task, which has received little attention from the computer vision and machine learning communities by now. We further show that the mechanism used to convert pairwise annotations to continuous values may magnify the biases if no special treatment is considered. The findings of this study are relevant for the computer vision community that is still creating new datasets on subjective tasks, and using them for practical applications, ignoring these perceptual biases.      
### 16.Occlusion Guided Scene Flow Estimation on 3D Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14880.pdf)
>  3D scene flow estimation is a vital tool in perceiving our environment given depth or range sensors. Unlike optical flow, the data is usually sparse and in most cases partially occluded in between two temporal samplings. Here we propose a new scene flow architecture called OGSF-Net which tightly couples the learning for both flow and occlusions between frames. Their coupled symbiosis results in a more accurate prediction of flow in space. Unlike a traditional multi-action network, our unified approach is fused throughout the network, boosting performances for both occlusion detection and flow estimation. Our architecture is the first to gauge the occlusion in 3D scene flow estimation on point clouds. In key datasets such as Flyingthings3D and KITTI, we achieve the state-of-the-art results.      
### 17.A Tiny CNN Architecture for Medical Face Mask Detection for Resource-Constrained Endpoints  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14858.pdf)
>  The world is going through one of the most dangerous pandemics of all time with the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). According to the World Health Organisation, the most effective way to thwart the transmission of coronavirus is to wear medical face masks. Monitoring the use of face masks in public places has been a challenge because manual monitoring could be unsafe. This paper proposes an architecture for detecting medical face masks for deployment on resource-constrained endpoints having extremely low memory footprints. A small development board with an ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller clocked at 480 Mhz and having just 496 KB of framebuffer RAM, has been used for the deployment of the model. Using the TensorFlow Lite framework, the model is quantized to further reduce its size. The proposed model is 138 KB post quantization and runs at the inference speed of 30 FPS.      
### 18.Unsupervised Optical Flow Using Cost Function Unrolling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14814.pdf)
>  Analyzing motion between two consecutive images is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision. In the lack of labeled data, the loss functions are split into consistency and smoothness, allowing for self-supervised training. This paper focuses on the cost function derivation and presents an unrolling iterative approach, transferring the hard L1 smoothness constraint into a softer multi-layer iterative scheme. More accurate gradients, especially near non-differential positions, improve the network's convergence, providing superior results on tested scenarios. We report state-of-the-art results on both MPI Sintel and KITTI 2015 unsupervised optical flow benchmarks. The provided approach can be used to enhance various architectures and not limited just to the presented pipeline.      
### 19.NeuralFusion: Online Depth Fusion in Latent Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14791.pdf)
>  We present a novel online depth map fusion approach that learns depth map aggregation in a latent feature space. While previous fusion methods use an explicit scene representation like signed distance functions (SDFs), we propose a learned feature representation for the fusion. The key idea is a separation between the scene representation used for the fusion and the output scene representation, via an additional translator network. Our neural network architecture consists of two main parts: a depth and feature fusion sub-network, which is followed by a translator sub-network to produce the final surface representation (e.g. TSDF) for visualization or other tasks. Our approach is real-time capable, handles high noise levels, and is particularly able to deal with gross outliers common for photometric stereo-based depth maps. Experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate improved results compared to the state of the art, especially in challenging scenarios with large amounts of noise and outliers.      
### 20.S2FGAN: Semantically Aware Interactive Sketch-to-Face Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14785.pdf)
>  Interactive facial image manipulation attempts to edit single and multiple face attributes using a photo-realistic face and/or semantic mask as input. In the absence of the photo-realistic image (only sketch/mask available), previous methods only retrieve the original face but ignore the potential of aiding model controllability and diversity in the translation process. This paper proposes a sketch-to-image generation framework called S2FGAN, aiming to improve users' ability to interpret and flexibility of face attribute editing from a simple sketch. The proposed framework modifies the constrained latent space semantics trained on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We employ two latent spaces to control the face appearance and adjust the desired attributes of the generated face. Instead of constraining the translation process by using a reference image, the users can command the model to retouch the generated images by involving the semantic information in the generation process. In this way, our method can manipulate single or multiple face attributes by only specifying attributes to be changed. Extensive experimental results on CelebAMask-HQ dataset empirically shows our superior performance and effectiveness on this task. Our method successfully outperforms state-of-the-art methods on attribute manipulation by exploiting greater control of attribute intensity.      
### 21.How Good MVSNets Are at Depth Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14761.pdf)
>  We study the effects of the additional input to deep multi-view stereo methods in the form of low-quality sensor depth. We modify two state-of-the-art deep multi-view stereo methods for using with the input depth. We show that the additional input depth may improve the quality of deep multi-view stereo.      
### 22.Scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14759.pdf)
>  This article presents a hybrid approach between scale-space theory and deep learning, where a deep learning architecture is constructed by coupling parameterized scale-space operations in cascade. By sharing the learnt parameters between multiple scale channels, and by using the transformation properties of the scale-space primitives under scaling transformations, the resulting network becomes provably scale covariant. By in addition performing max pooling over the multiple scale channels, a resulting network architecture for image classification also becomes provably scale invariant. We investigate the performance of such networks on the MNISTLargeScale dataset, which contains rescaled images from original MNIST over a factor 4 concerning training data and over a factor of 16 concerning testing data. It is demonstrated that the resulting approach allows for scale generalization, enabling good performance for classifying patterns at scales not present in the training data.      
### 23.A Comprehensive Review on Recent Methods and Challenges of Video Description  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14752.pdf)
>  Video description involves the generation of the natural language description of actions, events, and objects in the video. There are various applications of video description by filling the gap between languages and vision for visually impaired people, generating automatic title suggestion based on content, browsing of the video based on the content and video-guided machine translation [86] <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://etc.In" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> the past decade, several works had been done in this field in terms of approaches/methods for video description, evaluation metrics,and datasets. For analyzing the progress in the video description task, a comprehensive survey is needed that covers all the phases of video description approaches with a special focus on recent deep learning approaches. In this work, we report a comprehensive survey on the phases of video description approaches, the dataset for video description, evaluation metrics, open competitions for motivating the research on the video description, open challenges in this field, and future research directions. In this survey, we cover the state-of-the-art approaches proposed for each and every dataset with their pros and cons. For the growth of this research domain,the availability of numerous benchmark dataset is a basic need. Further, we categorize all the dataset into two classes: open domain dataset and domain-specific dataset. From our survey, we observe that the work in this field is in fast-paced development since the task of video description falls in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. But still, the work in the video description is far from saturation stage due to various challenges like the redundancy due to similar frames which affect the quality of visual features, the availability of dataset containing more diverse content and availability of an effective evaluation metric.      
### 24.RfD-Net: Point Scene Understanding by Semantic Instance Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14744.pdf)
>  Semantic scene understanding from point clouds is particularly challenging as the points reflect only a sparse set of the underlying 3D geometry. Previous works often convert point cloud into regular grids (e.g. voxels or bird-eye view images), and resort to grid-based convolutions for scene understanding. In this work, we introduce RfD-Net that jointly detects and reconstructs dense object surfaces directly from raw point clouds. Instead of representing scenes with regular grids, our method leverages the sparsity of point cloud data and focuses on predicting shapes that are recognized with high objectness. With this design, we decouple the instance reconstruction into global object localization and local shape prediction. It not only eases the difficulty of learning 2-D manifold surfaces from sparse 3D space, the point clouds in each object proposal convey shape details that support implicit function learning to reconstruct any high-resolution surfaces. Our experiments indicate that instance detection and reconstruction present complementary effects, where the shape prediction head shows consistent effects on improving object detection with modern 3D proposal network backbones. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations further demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts and improves over 11 of mesh IoU in object reconstruction.      
### 25.Dual Geometric Graph Network (DG2N) -- Zero-Shot Refinement for Dense Shape Correspondence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14723.pdf)
>  We provide a novel new approach for aligning geometric models using a dual graph structure where local features are mapping probabilities. Alignment of non-rigid structures is one of the most challenging computer vision tasks due to the high number of unknowns needed to model the correspondence. We have seen a leap forward using DNN models in template alignment and functional maps, but those methods fail for inter-class alignment where nonisometric deformations exist. Here we propose to rethink this task and use unrolling concepts on a dual graph structure - one for a forward map and one for a backward map, where the features are pulled back matching probabilities from the target into the source. We report state of the art results on stretchable domains alignment in a rapid and stable solution for meshes and cloud of points.      
### 26.BOTD: Bold Outline Text Detector  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14714.pdf)
>  Recently, text detection for arbitrary shape has attracted more and more search attention. Although segmentation-based methods, which are not limited by the text shape, have been studied to improve the performance, the slow detection speed, complicated post-processing, and text adhesion problem are still limitations for the practical application. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective arbitrary-shape text detector, named Bold Outline Text Detector (BOTD). It is a novel one-stage detection framework with few post-processing processes. At the same time, the text adhesion problem can also be well alleviated. Specifically, BOTD first generates a center mask (CM) for each text instance, which makes the adhesive text easy to distinguish. Base on the CM, we further compute the polar minimum distance (PMD) for each text instance. PMD denotes the shortest distance between the center point of CM and the outline of the text instance. By dividing the text mask into CM and PMD, the outline of arbitrary-shape text instance can be obtained by simply predicting its CM and PMD. Without any bells and whistles, BOTD achieves an F-measure of 80.1% on CTW1500 with 52 FPS. Note that the post-processing time only accounts for 9% of the whole inference time. Code and trained models will be publicly available soon.      
### 27.Adaptive Compact Attention For Few-shot Video-to-video Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14695.pdf)
>  This paper proposes an adaptive compact attention model for few-shot video-to-video translation. Existing works in this domain only use features from pixel-wise attention without considering the correlations among multiple reference images, which leads to heavy computation but limited performance. Therefore, we introduce a novel adaptive compact attention mechanism to efficiently extract contextual features jointly from multiple reference images, of which encoded view-dependent and motion-dependent information can significantly benefit the synthesis of realistic videos. Our core idea is to extract compact basis sets from all the reference images as higher-level representations. To further improve the reliability, in the inference phase, we also propose a novel method based on the Delaunay Triangulation algorithm to automatically select the resourceful references according to the input label. We extensively evaluate our method on a large-scale talking-head video dataset and a human dancing dataset; the experimental results show the superior performance of our method for producing photorealistic and temporally consistent videos, and considerable improvements over the state-of-the-art method.      
### 28.CanonPose: Self-Supervised Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation in the Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14679.pdf)
>  Human pose estimation from single images is a challenging problem in computer vision that requires large amounts of labeled training data to be solved accurately. Unfortunately, for many human activities (\eg outdoor sports) such training data does not exist and is hard or even impossible to acquire with traditional motion capture systems. We propose a self-supervised approach that learns a single image 3D pose estimator from unlabeled multi-view data. To this end, we exploit multi-view consistency constraints to disentangle the observed 2D pose into the underlying 3D pose and camera rotation. In contrast to most existing methods, we do not require calibrated cameras and can therefore learn from moving cameras. Nevertheless, in the case of a static camera setup, we present an optional extension to include constant relative camera rotations over multiple views into our framework. Key to the success are new, unbiased reconstruction objectives that mix information across views and training samples. The proposed approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets (Human3.6M and MPII-INF-3DHP) and on the in-the-wild SkiPose dataset.      
### 29.HybrIK: A Hybrid Analytical-Neural Inverse Kinematics Solution for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14672.pdf)
>  Model-based 3D pose and shape estimation methods reconstruct a full 3D mesh for the human body by estimating several parameters. However, learning the abstract parameters is a highly non-linear process and suffers from image-model misalignment, leading to mediocre model performance. In contrast, 3D keypoint estimation methods combine deep CNN network with the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level localization accuracy but may predict unrealistic body structure. In this paper, we address the above issues by bridging the gap between body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation. We propose a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK). HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to relative body-part rotations for 3D body mesh reconstruction, via the twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotation is analytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the visual cues through the neural network. We show that HybrIK preserves both the accuracy of 3D pose and the realistic body structure of the parametric human model, leading to a pixel-aligned 3D body mesh and a more accurate 3D pose than the pure 3D keypoint estimation methods. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on various 3D human pose and shape benchmarks. As an illustrative example, HybrIK outperforms all the previous methods by 13.2 mm MPJPE and 21.9 mm PVE on 3DPW dataset.

### 30.Meta Batch-Instance Normalization for Generalizable Person Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14670.pdf)
>  Although supervised person re-identification (Re-ID) methods have shown impressive performance, they suffer from a poor generalization capability on unseen domains. Therefore, generalizable Re-ID has recently attracted growing attention. Many existing methods have employed an instance normalization technique to reduce style variations, but the loss of discriminative information could not be avoided. In this paper, we propose a novel generalizable Re-ID framework, named Meta Batch-Instance Normalization (MetaBIN). Our main idea is to generalize normalization layers by simulating unsuccessful generalization scenarios beforehand in the meta-learning pipeline. To this end, we combine learnable batch-instance normalization layers with meta-learning and investigate the challenging cases caused by both batch and instance normalization layers. Moreover, we diversify the virtual simulations via our meta-train loss accompanied by a cyclic inner-updating manner to boost generalization capability. After all, the MetaBIN framework prevents our model from overfitting to the given source styles and improves the generalization capability to unseen domains without additional data augmentation or complicated network design. Extensive experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmark.      
### 31.Where to Explore Next? ExHistCNN for History-aware Autonomous 3D Exploration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14669.pdf)
>  In this work we address the problem of autonomous 3D exploration of an unknown indoor environment using a depth camera. We cast the problem as the estimation of the Next Best View (NBV) that maximises the coverage of the unknown area. We do this by re-formulating NBV estimation as a classification problem and we propose a novel learning-based metric that encodes both, the current 3D observation (a depth frame) and the history of the ongoing reconstruction. One of the major contributions of this work is about introducing a new representation for the 3D reconstruction history as an auxiliary utility map which is efficiently coupled with the current depth observation. With both pieces of information, we train a light-weight CNN, named ExHistCNN, that estimates the NBV as a set of directions towards which the depth sensor finds most unexplored areas. We perform extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real room scans demonstrating that the proposed ExHistCNN is able to approach the exploration performance of an oracle using the complete knowledge of the 3D environment.      
### 32.AFD-Net: Adaptive Fully-Dual Network for Few-Shot Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14667.pdf)
>  Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims at learning a detector that can fast adapt to previously unseen objects with scarce annotated examples, which is challenging and demanding. Existing methods solve this problem by performing subtasks of classification and localization utilizing a shared component (e.g., RoI head) in a detector, yet few of them take the preference difference in embedding space of two subtasks into consideration. In this paper, we carefully analyze the characteristics of FSOD and present that a general few-shot detector should consider the explicit decomposition of two subtasks, and leverage information from both of them for enhancing feature representations. To the end, we propose a simple yet effective Adaptive Fully-Dual Network (AFD-Net). Specifically, we extend Faster R-CNN by introducing Dual Query Encoder and Dual Attention Generator for separate feature extraction, and Dual Aggregator for separate model reweighting. Spontaneously, separate decision making is achieved with the R-CNN detector. Besides, for the acquisition of enhanced feature representations, we further introduce Adaptive Fusion Mechanism to adaptively perform feature fusion suitable for the specific subtask. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO in various settings show that, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance by a large margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization ability.      
### 33.Why Convolutional Networks Learn Oriented Bandpass Filters: Theory and Empirical Support  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14665.pdf)
>  It has been repeatedly observed that convolutional architectures when applied to image understanding tasks learn oriented bandpass filters. A standard explanation of this result is that these filters reflect the structure of the images that they have been exposed to during training: Natural images typically are locally composed of oriented contours at various scales and oriented bandpass filters are matched to such structure. We offer an alternative explanation based not on the structure of images, but rather on the structure of convolutional architectures. In particular, complex exponentials are the eigenfunctions of convolution. These eigenfunctions are defined globally; however, convolutional architectures operate locally. To enforce locality, one can apply a windowing function to the eigenfunctions, which leads to oriented bandpass filters as the natural operators to be learned with convolutional architectures. From a representational point of view, these filters allow for a local systematic way to characterize and operate on an image or other signal. We offer empirical support for the hypothesis that convolutional networks learn such filters at all of their convolutional layers. While previous research has shown evidence of filters having oriented bandpass characteristics at early layers, ours appears to be the first study to document the predominance of such filter characteristics at all layers. Previous studies have missed this observation because they have concentrated on the cumulative compositional effects of filtering across layers, while we examine the filter characteristics that are present at each layer.      
### 34.Revisiting Unsupervised Meta-Learning: Amplifying or Compensating for the Characteristics of Few-Shot Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14663.pdf)
>  Meta-learning becomes a practical approach towards few-shot image classification, where a visual recognition system is constructed with limited annotated data. Inductive bias such as embedding is learned from a base class set with ample labeled examples and then generalizes to few-shot tasks with novel classes. Surprisingly, we find that the base class set labels are not necessary, and discriminative embeddings could be meta-learned in an unsupervised manner. Comprehensive analyses indicate two modifications -- the semi-normalized distance metric and the sufficient sampling -- improves unsupervised meta-learning (UML) significantly. Based on the modified baseline, we further amplify or compensate for the characteristic of tasks when training a UML model. First, mixed embeddings are incorporated to increase the difficulty of few-shot tasks. Next, we utilize a task-specific embedding transformation to deal with the specific properties among tasks, maintaining the generalization ability into the vanilla embeddings. Experiments on few-shot learning benchmarks verify that our approaches outperform previous UML methods by a 4-10% performance gap, and embeddings learned with our UML achieve comparable or even better performance than its supervised variants.      
### 35.SplitNet: Divide and Co-training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14660.pdf)
>  The width of a neural network matters since increasing the width will necessarily increase the model capacity. However, the performance of a network does not improve linearly with the width and soon gets saturated. To tackle this problem, we propose to increase the number of networks rather than purely scaling up the width. To prove it, one large network is divided into several small ones, and each of these small networks has a fraction of the original one's parameters. We then train these small networks together and make them see various views of the same data to learn different and complementary knowledge. During this co-training process, networks can also learn from each other. As a result, small networks can achieve better ensemble performance than the large one with few or no extra parameters or FLOPs. \emph{This reveals that the number of networks is a new dimension of effective model scaling, besides depth/width/resolution}. Small networks can also achieve faster inference speed than the large one by concurrent running on different devices. We validate the idea -- increasing the number of networks is a new dimension of effective model scaling -- with different network architectures on common benchmarks through extensive experiments. The code is available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/mzhaoshuai/SplitNet-Divide-and-Co-training" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 36.Vehicle Reconstruction and Texture Estimation Using Deep Implicit Semantic Template Mapping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14642.pdf)
>  We introduce VERTEX, an effective solution to recover 3D shape and intrinsic texture of vehicles from uncalibrated monocular input in real-world street environments. To fully utilize the template prior of vehicles, we propose a novel geometry and texture joint representation, based on implicit semantic template mapping. Compared to existing representations which infer 3D texture distribution, our method explicitly constrains the texture distribution on the 2D surface of the template as well as avoids limitations of fixed resolution and topology. Moreover, by fusing the global and local features together, our approach is capable to generate consistent and detailed texture in both visible and invisible areas. We also contribute a new synthetic dataset containing 830 elaborate textured car models labeled with sparse key points and rendered using Physically Based Rendering (PBRT) system with measured HDRI skymaps to obtain highly realistic images. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach on both testing dataset and in-the-wild images. Furthermore, the presented technique enables additional applications such as 3D vehicle texture transfer and material identification.      
### 37.Cross-MPI: Cross-scale Stereo for Image Super-Resolution using Multiplane Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14631.pdf)
>  The combination of various cameras is enriching the way of computational photography, among which referencebased super-resolution (RefSR) plays a critical role in multiscale imaging systems. However, existing RefSR approaches fail to accomplish high-fidelity super-resolution under a large resolution gap, e.g., 8x upscaling, due to the less consideration of underneath scene structure. In this paper, we aim to solve the RefSR problem (in actual multiscale camera systems) inspired by multiplane images (MPI) representation. Specifically, we propose Cross-MPI, an end-to-end RefSR network composed of a novel planeaware attention-based MPI mechanism, a multiscale guided upsampling module as well as a super-resolution (SR) synthesis and fusion module. Instead of using a direct and exhaustive matching between the cross-scale stereo, the proposed plane-aware attention mechanism fully utilizes the concealed scene structure for efficient attention-based correspondence searching. Further combined with a gentle coarse-to-fine guided upsampling strategy, the proposed Cross-MPI is able to achieve a robust and accurate detail transmission. Experimental results on both digital synthesized and optical zoomed cross-scale data show the Cross- MPI framework can achieve superior performance against the existing RefSR methods, and is a real fit for actual multiscale camera systems even with large scale differences.      
### 38.DeepCloth: Neural Garment Representation for Shape and Style Editing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14619.pdf)
>  Garment representation, animation and editing is a challenging topic in the area of computer vision and graphics. Existing methods cannot perform smooth and reasonable garment transition under different shape styles and topologies. In this work, we introduce a novel method, termed as DeepCloth, to establish a unified garment representation framework enabling free and smooth garment style transition. Our key idea is to represent garment geometry by a "UV-position map with mask", which potentially allows the description of various garments with different shapes and topologies. Furthermore, we learn a continuous feature space mapped from the above UV space, enabling garment shape editing and transition by controlling the garment features. Finally, we demonstrate applications of garment animation, reconstruction and editing based on our neural garment representation and encoding method. To conclude, with the proposed DeepCloth, we move a step forward on establishing a more flexible and general 3D garment digitization framework. Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art garment modeling results compared with the previous methods.      
### 39.SIR: Self-supervised Image Rectification via Seeing the Same Scene from Multiple Different Lenses  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14611.pdf)
>  Deep learning has demonstrated its power in image rectification by leveraging the representation capacity of deep neural networks via supervised training based on a large-scale synthetic dataset. However, the model may overfit the synthetic images and generalize not well on real-world fisheye images due to the limited universality of a specific distortion model and the lack of explicitly modeling the distortion and rectification process. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised image rectification (SIR) method based on an important insight that the rectified results of distorted images of the same scene from different lens should be the same. Specifically, we devise a new network architecture with a shared encoder and several prediction heads, each of which predicts the distortion parameter of a specific distortion model. We further leverage a differentiable warping module to generate the rectified images and re-distorted images from the distortion parameters and exploit the intra- and inter-model consistency between them during training, thereby leading to a self-supervised learning scheme without the need for ground-truth distortion parameters or normal images. Experiments on synthetic dataset and real-world fisheye images demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even better performance than the supervised baseline method and representative state-of-the-art methods. Self-supervised learning also improves the universality of distortion models while keeping their self-consistency.      
### 40.Zero-Shot Calibration of Fisheye Cameras  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14607.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a novel zero-shot camera calibration method that estimates camera parameters with no calibration image. It is common sense that we need at least one or more pattern images for camera calibration. However, the proposed method estimates camera parameters from the horizontal and vertical field of view information of the camera without any image acquisition. The proposed method is particularly useful for wide-angle or fisheye cameras that have large image distortion. Image distortion is modeled in the way fisheye lenses are designed and estimated based on the square pixel assumption of the image sensors. The calibration accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated on eight different commercial cameras qualitatively and quantitatively, and compared with conventional calibration methods. The experimental results show that the calibration accuracy of the zero-shot method is comparable to conventional full calibration results. The method can be used as a practical alternative in real applications where individual calibration is difficult or impractical, and in most field applications where calibration accuracy is less critical. Moreover, the estimated camera parameters by the method can also be used to provide proper initialization of any existing calibration methods, making them to converge more stably and avoid local minima.      
### 41.REaL: Real-time Face Detection and Recognition Using Euclidean Space and Likelihood Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14603.pdf)
>  Detecting and recognizing faces accurately has always been a challenge. Differentiating facial features, training images, and producing quick results require a lot of computation. The REaL system we have proposed in this paper discusses its functioning and ways in which computations can be carried out in a short period. REaL experiments are carried out on live images and the recognition rates are promising. The system is also successful in removing non-human objects from its calculations. The system uses a local database to store captured images and feeds the neural network frequently. The captured images are cropped automatically to remove unwanted noise. The system calculates the Euler angles and the probability of whether the face is smiling, has its left eye, and right eyes open or not.      
### 42.Video Self-Stitching Graph Network for Temporal Action Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14598.pdf)
>  Temporal action localization (TAL) in videos is a challenging task, especially due to the large scale variation of actions. In the data, short actions usually occupy the major proportion, but have the lowest performance with all current methods. In this paper, we confront the challenge of short actions and propose a multi-level cross-scale solution dubbed as video self-stitching graph network (VSGN). We have two key components in VSGN: video self-stitching (VSS) and cross-scale graph pyramid network (xGPN). In VSS, we focus on a short period of a video and magnify it along the temporal dimension to obtain a larger scale. By our self-stitching approach, we are able to utilize the original clip and its magnified counterpart in one input sequence to take advantage of the complementary properties of both scales. The xGPN component further exploits the cross-scale correlations by a pyramid of cross-scale graph networks, each containing a hybrid temporal-graph module to aggregate features from across scales as well as within the same scale. Our VSGN not only enhances the feature representations, but also generates more positive anchors for short actions and more short training samples. Experiments demonstrate that VSGN obviously improves the localization performance of short actions as well as achieving the state-of-the-art overall performance on ActivityNet-v1.3, reaching an average mAP of 35.07 %.      
### 43.A CRF-based Framework for Tracklet Inactivation in Online Multi-Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14594.pdf)
>  Online multi-object tracking (MOT) is an active research topic in the domain of computer vision. In this paper, a CRF-based framework is put forward to tackle the tracklet inactivation issues in online MOT problems. We apply the proposed framework to one of the state-of-the-art online MOT trackers, Tracktor++. The baseline algorithm for online MOT has the drawback of simple strategy on tracklet inactivation, which relies merely on tracking hypotheses' classification scores partitioned by using a fixed threshold. To overcome such a drawback, a discrete conditional random field (CRF) is developed to exploit the intra-frame relationship between tracking hypotheses. Separate sets of feature functions are designed for the unary and binary terms in the CRF so as to cope with various challenges in practical situations. The hypothesis filtering and dummy nodes techniques are employed to handle the problem of varying CRF nodes in the MOT context. In this paper, the inference of CRF is achieved by using the loopy belief propagation algorithm, and the parameters of the CRF are determined by utilizing the maximum likelihood estimation method. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed tracker with our CRF-based framework outperforms the baseline on the MOT16 and MOT17 datasets. The extensibility of the proposed method is further validated by an extensive experiment.      
### 44.Monocular 3D Object Detection with Sequential Feature Association and Depth Hint Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14589.pdf)
>  Monocular 3D object detection is an active research topic due to its challenging nature and broad applying prospects. In this work, a single-stage keypoint-based network, named as FADNet, is presented to address the task of monocular 3D object detection with autonomous driving as the target application. In contrast to previous keypoint-based methods which adopt identical layouts for output branches, we propose to divide the output modalities into different groups according to the estimating difficulty, whereby different groups are treated differently. To this end, a convolutional gated recurrent unit (convGRU) is embedded into our network to enable sequential feature association across the convolutional features in different groups. The purpose of sequential feature association is to improve the accuracy of harder estimations under the guidance of easier ones. It is also observed that such design contributes to the geometric consistency between 2D and 3D estimations. Another contribution of this work is the strategy of depth hint augmentation. To provide characterized depth patterns as hints for depth estimation, a dedicated depth hint module is designed to generate row-wise features named as depth hints, which are explicitly supervised in a bin-wise manner. In the training stage, the regression outputs are uniformly encoded to enable loss disentanglement. The 2D loss term is further adapted to be depth-aware for improving the detection accuracy of small objects. The contributions of this work are validated by conducting experiments and ablation study on the KITTI3D benchmark. Without utilizing depth priors, post optimization, or other refinement modules, our network achieves the performance on par with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a decent running speed.

### 45.FactorizeNet: Progressive Depth Factorization for Efficient Network Architecture Exploration Under Quantization Constraints  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14586.pdf)
>  Depth factorization and quantization have emerged as two of the principal strategies for designing efficient deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures tailored for low-power inference on the edge. However, there is still little detailed understanding of how different depth factorization choices affect the final, trained distributions of each layer in a CNN, particularly in the situation of quantized weights and activations. In this study, we introduce a progressive depth factorization strategy for efficient CNN architecture exploration under quantization constraints. By algorithmically increasing the granularity of depth factorization in a progressive manner, the proposed strategy enables a fine-grained, low-level analysis of layer-wise distributions. Thus enabling the gain of in-depth, layer-level insights on efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs under fixed-precision quantization. Such a progressive depth factorization strategy also enables efficient identification of the optimal depth-factorized macroarchitecture design (which we will refer to here as FactorizeNet) based on the desired efficiency-accuracy requirements.      
### 46.Just One Moment: Inconspicuous One Frame Attack on Deep Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14585.pdf)
>  The video-based action recognition task has been extensively studied in recent years. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of deep learning-based action recognition methods against the adversarial attack using a new one frame attack that adds an inconspicuous perturbation to only a single frame of a given video clip. We investigate the effectiveness of our one frame attack on state-of-the-art action recognition models, along with thorough analysis of the vulnerability in terms of their model structure and perceivability of the perturbation. Our method shows high fooling rates and produces hardly perceivable perturbation to human observers, which is evaluated by a subjective test. In addition, we present a video-agnostic approach that finds a universal perturbation.      
### 47.ScaleNAS: One-Shot Learning of Scale-Aware Representations for Visual Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14584.pdf)
>  Scale variance among different sizes of body parts and objects is a challenging problem for visual recognition tasks. Existing works usually design dedicated backbone or apply Neural architecture Search(NAS) for each task to tackle this challenge. However, existing works impose significant limitations on the design or search space. To solve these problems, we present ScaleNAS, a one-shot learning method for exploring scale-aware representations. ScaleNAS solves multiple tasks at a time by searching multi-scale feature aggregation. ScaleNAS adopts a flexible search space that allows an arbitrary number of blocks and cross-scale feature fusions. To cope with the high search cost incurred by the flexible space, ScaleNAS employs one-shot learning for multi-scale supernet driven by grouped sampling and evolutionary search. Without further retraining, ScaleNet can be directly deployed for different visual recognition tasks with superior performance. We use ScaleNAS to create high-resolution models for two different tasks, ScaleNet-P for human pose estimation and ScaleNet-S for semantic segmentation. ScaleNet-P and ScaleNet-S outperform existing manually crafted and NAS-based methods in both tasks. When applying ScaleNet-P to bottom-up human pose estimation, it surpasses the state-of-the-art HigherHRNet. In particular, ScaleNet-P4 achieves 71.6% AP on COCO test-dev, achieving new state-of-the-art result.      
### 48.End-to-End 3D Point Cloud Learning for Registration Task Using Virtual Correspondences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14579.pdf)
>  3D Point cloud registration is still a very challenging topic due to the difficulty in finding the rigid transformation between two point clouds with partial correspondences, and it's even harder in the absence of any initial estimation information. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep-learning based approach to resolve the point cloud registration problem. Firstly, the revised LPD-Net is introduced to extract features and aggregate them with the graph network. Secondly, the self-attention mechanism is utilized to enhance the structure information in the point cloud and the cross-attention mechanism is designed to enhance the corresponding information between the two input point clouds. Based on which, the virtual corresponding points can be generated by a soft pointer based method, and finally, the point cloud registration problem can be solved by implementing the SVD method. Comparison results in ModelNet40 dataset validate that the proposed approach reaches the state-of-the-art in point cloud registration tasks and experiment resutls in KITTI dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in real applications.      
### 49.DUT:Learning Video Stabilization by Simply Watching Unstable Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14574.pdf)
>  We propose a Deep Unsupervised Trajectory-based stabilization framework (DUT) in this paper\footnote{Our code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Annbless/DUTCode" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.}. Traditional stabilizers focus on trajectory-based smoothing, which is controllable but fragile in occluded and textureless cases regarding the usage of hand-crafted features. On the other hand, previous deep video stabilizers directly generate stable videos in a supervised manner without explicit trajectory estimation, which is robust but less controllable and the appropriate paired data are hard to obtain. To construct a controllable and robust stabilizer, DUT makes the first attempt to stabilize unstable videos by explicitly estimating and smoothing trajectories in an unsupervised deep learning manner, which is composed of a DNN-based keypoint detector and motion estimator to generate grid-based trajectories, and a DNN-based trajectory smoother to stabilize videos. We exploit both the nature of continuity in motion and the consistency of keypoints and grid vertices before and after stabilization for unsupervised training. Experiment results on public benchmarks show that DUT outperforms representative state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 50.Deep Implicit Templates for 3D Shape Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14565.pdf)
>  Deep implicit functions (DIFs), as a kind of 3D shape representation, are becoming more and more popular in the 3D vision community due to their compactness and strong representation power. However, unlike polygon mesh-based templates, it remains a challenge to reason dense correspondences or other semantic relationships across shapes represented by DIFs, which limits its applications in texture transfer, shape analysis and so on. To overcome this limitation and also make DIFs more interpretable, we propose Deep Implicit Templates, a new 3D shape representation that supports explicit correspondence reasoning in deep implicit representations. Our key idea is to formulate DIFs as conditional deformations of a template implicit function. To this end, we propose Spatial Warping LSTM, which decomposes the conditional spatial transformation into multiple affine transformations and guarantees generalization capability. Moreover, the training loss is carefully designed in order to achieve high reconstruction accuracy while learning a plausible template with accurate correspondences in an unsupervised manner. Experiments show that our method can not only learn a common implicit template for a collection of shapes, but also establish dense correspondences across all the shapes simultaneously without any supervision.      
### 51.Learnable Motion Coherence for Correspondence Pruning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14563.pdf)
>  Motion coherence is an important clue for distinguishing true correspondences from false ones. Modeling motion coherence on sparse putative correspondences is challenging due to their sparsity and uneven distributions. Existing works on motion coherence are sensitive to parameter settings and have difficulty in dealing with complex motion patterns. In this paper, we introduce a network called Laplacian Motion Coherence Network (LMCNet) to learn motion coherence property for correspondence pruning. We propose a novel formulation of fitting coherent motions with a smooth function on a graph of correspondences and show that this formulation allows a closed-form solution by graph Laplacian. This closed-form solution enables us to design a differentiable layer in a learning framework to capture global motion coherence from putative correspondences. The global motion coherence is further combined with local coherence extracted by another local layer to robustly detect inlier correspondences. Experiments demonstrate that LMCNet has superior performances to the state of the art in relative camera pose estimation and correspondences pruning of dynamic scenes.      
### 52.Heuristic Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14540.pdf)
>  In visual domain adaptation (DA), separating the domain-specific characteristics from the domain-invariant representations is an ill-posed problem. Existing methods apply different kinds of priors or directly minimize the domain discrepancy to address this problem, which lack flexibility in handling real-world situations. Another research pipeline expresses the domain-specific information as a gradual transferring process, which tends to be suboptimal in accurately removing the domain-specific properties. In this paper, we address the modeling of domain-invariant and domain-specific information from the heuristic search perspective. We identify the characteristics in the existing representations that lead to larger domain discrepancy as the heuristic representations. With the guidance of heuristic representations, we formulate a principled framework of Heuristic Domain Adaptation (HDA) with well-founded theoretical guarantees. To perform HDA, the cosine similarity scores and independence measurements between domain-invariant and domain-specific representations are cast into the constraints at the initial and final states during the learning procedure. Similar to the final condition of heuristic search, we further derive a constraint enforcing the final range of heuristic network output to be small. Accordingly, we propose Heuristic Domain Adaptation Network (HDAN), which explicitly learns the domain-invariant and domain-specific representations with the above mentioned constraints. Extensive experiments show that HDAN has exceeded state-of-the-art on unsupervised DA, multi-source DA and semi-supervised DA.

### 53.Inter-layer Transition in Neural Architecture Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14525.pdf)
>  Differential Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods represent the network architecture as a repetitive proxy directed acyclic graph (DAG) and optimize the network weights and architecture weights alternatively in a differential manner. However, existing methods model the architecture weights on each edge (i.e., a layer in the network) as statistically independent variables, ignoring the dependency between edges in DAG induced by their directed topological connections. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate such dependency by proposing a novel Inter-layer Transition NAS method. It casts the architecture optimization into a sequential decision process where the dependency between the architecture weights of connected edges is explicitly modeled. Specifically, edges are divided into inner and outer groups according to whether or not their predecessor edges are in the same cell. While the architecture weights of outer edges are optimized independently, those of inner edges are derived sequentially based on the architecture weights of their predecessor edges and the learnable transition matrices in an attentive probability transition manner. Experiments on five benchmarks confirm the value of modeling inter-layer dependency and demonstrate the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.      
### 54.Training and Inference for Integer-Based Semantic Segmentation Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14504.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation has been a major topic in research and industry in recent years. However, due to the computation complexity of pixel-wise prediction and backpropagation algorithm, semantic segmentation has been demanding in computation resources, resulting in slow training and inference speed and large storage space to store models. Existing schemes that speed up segmentation network change the network structure and come with noticeable accuracy degradation. However, neural network quantization can be used to reduce computation load while maintaining comparable accuracy and original network structure. Semantic segmentation networks are different from traditional deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) in many ways, and this topic has not been thoroughly explored in existing works. In this paper, we propose a new quantization framework for training and inference of segmentation networks, where parameters and operations are constrained to 8-bit integer-based values for the first time. Full quantization of the data flow and the removal of square and root operations in batch normalization give our framework the ability to perform inference on fixed-point devices. Our proposed framework is evaluated on mainstream semantic segmentation networks like FCN-VGG16 and DeepLabv3-ResNet50, achieving comparable accuracy against floating-point framework on ADE20K dataset and PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.      
### 55.End-to-End Video Instance Segmentation with Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14503.pdf)
>  Video instance segmentation (VIS) is the task that requires simultaneously classifying, segmenting and tracking object instances of interest in video. Recent methods typically develop sophisticated pipelines to tackle this task. Here, we propose a new video instance segmentation framework built upon Transformers, termed VisTR, which views the VIS task as a direct end-to-end parallel sequence decoding/prediction problem. Given a video clip consisting of multiple image frames as input, VisTR outputs the sequence of masks for each instance in the video in order directly. At the core is a new, effective instance sequence matching and segmentation strategy, which supervises and segments instances at the sequence level as a whole. VisTR frames the instance segmentation and tracking in the same perspective of similarity learning, thus considerably simplifying the overall pipeline and is significantly different from existing approaches. Without bells and whistles, VisTR achieves the highest speed among all existing VIS models, and achieves the best result among methods using single model on the YouTube-VIS dataset. For the first time, we demonstrate a much simpler and faster video instance segmentation framework built upon Transformers, achieving competitive accuracy. We hope that VisTR can motivate future research for more video understanding tasks.      
### 56.Sim2SG: Sim-to-Real Scene Graph Generation for Transfer Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14488.pdf)
>  Scene graph (SG) generation has been gaining a lot of traction recently. Current SG generation techniques, however, rely on the availability of expensive and limited number of labeled datasets. Synthetic data offers a viable alternative as labels are essentially free. However, neural network models trained on synthetic data, do not perform well on real data because of the domain gap. To overcome this challenge, we propose Sim2SG, a scalable technique for sim-to-real transfer for scene graph generation. Sim2SG addresses the domain gap by decomposing it into appearance, label and prediction discrepancies between the two domains. We handle these discrepancies by introducing pseudo statistic based self-learning and adversarial techniques. Sim2SG does not require costly supervision from the real-world dataset. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines in reducing the domain gap both qualitatively and quantitatively. We validate our approach on toy simulators, as well as realistic simulators evaluated on real-world data.      
### 57.Multi-scale Adaptive Task Attention Network for Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14479.pdf)
>  The goal of few-shot learning is to classify unseen categories with few labeled samples. Recently, the low-level information metric-learning based methods have achieved satisfying performance, since local representations (LRs) are more consistent between seen and unseen classes. However, most of these methods deal with each category in the support set independently, which is not sufficient to measure the relation between features, especially in a certain task. Moreover, the low-level information-based metric learning method suffers when dominant objects of different scales exist in a complex background. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Multi-scale Adaptive Task Attention Network (MATANet) for few-shot learning. Specifically, we first use a multi-scale feature generator to generate multiple features at different scales. Then, an adaptive task attention module is proposed to select the most important LRs among the entire task. Afterwards, a similarity-to-class module and a fusion layer are utilized to calculate a joint multi-scale similarity between the query image and the support set. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed MATANet compared with state-of-the-art methods.      
### 58.Annotation-Efficient Untrimmed Video Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14478.pdf)
>  Deep learning has achieved great success in recognizing video actions, but the collection and annotation of training data are still laborious, which mainly lies in two aspects: (1) the amount of required annotated data is large; (2) temporally annotating the location of each action is time-consuming. Works such as few-shot learning or untrimmed video recognition have been proposed to handle either one aspect or the other. However, very few existing works can handle both aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we target a new problem, Annotation-Efficient Video Recognition, to reduce the requirement of annotations for both large amount of samples from different classes and the action locations. Challenges of this problem come from three folds: (1) action recognition from untrimmed videos, (2) weak supervision, and (3) novel classes with only a few training samples. To address the first two challenges, we propose a background pseudo-labeling method based on open-set detection. To tackle the third challenge, we propose a self-weighted classification mechanism and a contrastive learning method to separate background and foreground of the untrimmed videos. Extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.2 and ActivityNet v1.3 verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Codes will be released online.      
### 59.What Can Style Transfer and Paintings Do For Model Robustness?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14477.pdf)
>  A common strategy for improving model robustness is through data augmentations. Data augmentations encourage models to learn desired invariances, such as invariance to horizontal flipping or small changes in color. Recent work has shown that arbitrary style transfer can be used as a form of data augmentation to encourage invariance to textures by creating painting-like images from photographs. However, a stylized photograph is not quite the same as an artist-created painting. Artists depict perceptually meaningful cues in paintings so that humans can recognize salient components in scenes, an emphasis which is not enforced in style transfer. Therefore, we study how style transfer and paintings differ in their impact on model robustness. First, we investigate the role of paintings as style images for stylization-based data augmentation. We find that style transfer functions well even without paintings as style images. Second, we show that learning from paintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation can improve model robustness. Finally, we investigate the invariances learned from stylization and from paintings, and show that models learn different invariances from these differing forms of data. Our results provide insights into how stylization improves model robustness, and provide evidence that artist-created paintings can be a valuable source of data for model robustness.      
### 60.Conditional Link Prediction of Category-Implicit Keypoint Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14462.pdf)
>  Keypoints of objects reflect their concise abstractions, while the corresponding connection links (CL) build the skeleton by detecting the intrinsic relations between keypoints. Existing approaches are typically computationally-intensive, inapplicable for instances belonging to multiple classes, and/or infeasible to simultaneously encode connection information. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose an end-to-end category-implicit Keypoint and Link Prediction Network (KLPNet), which is the first approach for simultaneous semantic keypoint detection (for multi-class instances) and CL rejuvenation. In our KLPNet, a novel Conditional Link Prediction Graph is proposed for link prediction among keypoints that are contingent on a predefined category. Furthermore, a Cross-stage Keypoint Localization Module (CKLM) is introduced to explore feature aggregation for coarse-to-fine keypoint localization. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our KLPNet consistently outperforms all other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the experimental results of CL prediction also show the effectiveness of our KLPNet with respect to occlusion problems.      
### 61.Improved Handling of Motion Blur in Online Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14448.pdf)
>  We wish to detect specific categories of objects, for online vision systems that will run in the real world. Object detection is already very challenging. It is even harder when the images are blurred, from the camera being in a car or a hand-held phone. Most existing efforts either focused on sharp images, with easy to label ground truth, or they have treated motion blur as one of many generic corruptions. <br>Instead, we focus especially on the details of egomotion induced blur. We explore five classes of remedies, where each targets different potential causes for the performance gap between sharp and blurred images. For example, first deblurring an image changes its human interpretability, but at present, only partly improves object detection. The other four classes of remedies address multi-scale texture, out-of-distribution testing, label generation, and conditioning by blur-type. Surprisingly, we discover that custom label generation aimed at resolving spatial ambiguity, ahead of all others, markedly improves object detection. Also, in contrast to findings from classification, we see a noteworthy boost by conditioning our model on bespoke categories of motion blur. We validate and cross-breed the different remedies experimentally on blurred COCO images, producing an easy and practical favorite model with superior detection rates.      
### 62.Intrinsic Decomposition of Document Images In-the-Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14447.pdf)
>  Automatic document content processing is affected by artifacts caused by the shape of the paper, non-uniform and diverse color of lighting conditions. Fully-supervised methods on real data are impossible due to the large amount of data needed. Hence, the current state of the art deep learning models are trained on fully or partially synthetic images. However, document shadow or shading removal results still suffer because: (a) prior methods rely on uniformity of local color statistics, which limit their application on real-scenarios with complex document shapes and textures and; (b) synthetic or hybrid datasets with non-realistic, simulated lighting conditions are used to train the models. In this paper we tackle these problems with our two main contributions. First, a physically constrained learning-based method that directly estimates document reflectance based on intrinsic image formation which generalizes to challenging illumination conditions. Second, a new dataset that clearly improves previous synthetic ones, by adding a large range of realistic shading and diverse multi-illuminant conditions, uniquely customized to deal with documents in-the-wild. The proposed architecture works in a self-supervised manner where only the synthetic texture is used as a weak training signal (obviating the need for very costly ground truth with disentangled versions of shading and reflectance). The proposed approach leads to a significant generalization of document reflectance estimation in real scenes with challenging illumination. We extensively evaluate on the real benchmark datasets available for intrinsic image decomposition and document shadow removal tasks. Our reflectance estimation scheme, when used as a pre-processing step of an OCR pipeline, shows a 26% improvement of character error rate (CER), thus, proving the practical applicability.      
### 63.LABNet: Local Graph Aggregation Network with Class Balanced Loss for Vehicle Re-Identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14417.pdf)
>  Vehicle re-identification is an important computer vision task where the objective is to identify a specific vehicle among a set of vehicles seen at various viewpoints. Recent methods based on deep learning utilize a global average pooling layer after the backbone feature extractor, however, this ignores any spatial reasoning on the feature map. In this paper, we propose local graph aggregation on the backbone feature map, to learn associations of local information and hence improve feature learning as well as reduce the effects of partial occlusion and background clutter. Our local graph aggregation network considers spatial regions of the feature map as nodes and builds a local neighborhood graph that performs local feature aggregation before the global average pooling layer. We further utilize a batch normalization layer to improve the system effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce a class balanced loss to compensate for the imbalance in the sample distributions found in the most widely used vehicle re-identification datasets. Finally, we evaluate our method in three popular benchmarks and show that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art methods.      
### 64.Reconfigurable Cyber-Physical System for Critical Infrastructure Protection in Smart Cities via Smart Video-Surveillance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14416.pdf)
>  Automated surveillance is essential for the protection of Critical Infrastructures (CIs) in future Smart Cities. The dynamic environments and bandwidth requirements demand systems that adapt themselves to react when events of interest occur. We present a reconfigurable Cyber Physical System for the protection of CIs using distributed cloud-edge smart video surveillance. Our local edge nodes perform people detection via Deep Learning. Processing is embedded in high performance SoCs (System-on-Chip) achieving real-time performance ($\approx$ 100 fps - frames per second) which enables efficiently managing video streams of more cameras source at lower frame rate. Cloud server gathers results from nodes to carry out biometric facial identification, tracking, and perimeter monitoring. A Quality and Resource Management module monitors data bandwidth and triggers reconfiguration adapting the transmitted video resolution. This also enables a flexible use of the network by multiple cameras while maintaining the accuracy of biometric identification. A real-world example shows a reduction of $\approx$ 75\% bandwidth use with respect to the no-reconfiguration scenario.      
### 65.RGBD-Net: Predicting color and depth images for novel views synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14398.pdf)
>  We address the problem of novel view synthesis from an unstructured set of reference images. A new method called RGBD-Net is proposed to predict the depth map and the color images at the target pose in a multi-scale manner. The reference views are warped to the target pose to obtain multi-scale plane sweep volumes, which are then passed to our first module, a hierarchical depth regression network which predicts the depth map of the novel view. Second, a depth-aware generator network refines the warped novel views and renders the final target image. These two networks can be trained with or without depth supervision. In experimental evaluation, RGBD-Net not only produces novel views with higher quality than the previous state-of-the-art methods, but also the obtained depth maps enable reconstruction of more accurate 3D point clouds than the existing multi-view stereo methods. The results indicate that RGBD-Net generalizes well to previously unseen data.      
### 66.Constraining Volume Change in Learned Image Registration for Lung CTs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14372.pdf)
>  Deep-learning-based registration methods emerged as a fast alternative to conventional registration methods. However, these methods often still cannot achieve the same performance as conventional registration methods, because they are either limited to small deformation or they fail to handle a superposition of large and small deformations without producing implausible deformation fields with foldings inside. <br>In this paper, we identify important strategies of conventional registration methods for lung registration and successfully developed the deep-learning counterpart. We employ a Gaussian-pyramid-based multilevel framework that can solve the image registration optimization in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Furthermore, we prevent foldings of the deformation field and restrict the determinant of the Jacobian to physiologically meaningful values by combining a volume change penalty with a curvature regularizer in the loss function. Keypoint correspondences are integrated to focus on the alignment of smaller structures. <br>We perform an extensive evaluation to assess the accuracy, the robustness, the plausibility of the estimated deformation fields, and the transferability of our registration approach. We show that it archives state-of-the-art results on the COPDGene dataset compared to the challenge winning conventional registration method with much shorter execution time.      
### 67.Exploring Deep 3D Spatial Encodings for Large-Scale 3D Scene Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14358.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation of raw 3D point clouds is an essential component in 3D scene analysis, but it poses several challenges, primarily due to the non-Euclidean nature of 3D point clouds. Although, several deep learning based approaches have been proposed to address this task, but almost all of them emphasized on using the latent (global) feature representations from traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN), resulting in severe loss of spatial information, thus failing to model the geometry of the underlying 3D objects, that plays an important role in remote sensing 3D scenes. In this letter, we have proposed an alternative approach to overcome the limitations of CNN based approaches by encoding the spatial features of raw 3D point clouds into undirected symmetrical graph models. These encodings are then combined with a high-dimensional feature vector extracted from a traditional CNN into a localized graph convolution operator that outputs the required 3D segmentation map. We have performed experiments on two standard benchmark datasets (including an outdoor aerial remote sensing dataset and an indoor synthetic dataset). The proposed method achieves on par state-of-the-art accuracy with improved training time and model stability thus indicating strong potential for further research towards a generalized state-of-the-art method for 3D scene understanding.      
### 68.Layer Pruning via Fusible Residual Convolutional Block for Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14356.pdf)
>  In order to deploy deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-limited devices, many model pruning methods for filters and weights have been developed, while only a few to layer pruning. However, compared with filter pruning and weight pruning, the compact model obtained by layer pruning has less inference time and run-time memory usage when the same FLOPs and number of parameters are pruned because of less data moving in memory. In this paper, we propose a simple layer pruning method using fusible residual convolutional block (ResConv), which is implemented by inserting shortcut connection with a trainable information control parameter into a single convolutional layer. Using ResConv structures in training can improve network accuracy and train deep plain networks, and adds no additional computation during inference process because ResConv is fused to be an ordinary convolutional layer after training. For layer pruning, we convert convolutional layers of network into ResConv with a layer scaling factor. In the training process, the L1 regularization is adopted to make the scaling factors sparse, so that unimportant layers are automatically identified and then removed, resulting in a model of layer reduction. Our pruning method achieves excellent performance of compression and acceleration over the state-of-the-arts on different datasets, and needs no retraining in the case of low pruning rate. For example, with ResNet-110, we achieve a 65.5%-FLOPs reduction by removing 55.5% of the parameters, with only a small loss of 0.13% in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10.      
### 69.ProtoPShare: Prototype Sharing for Interpretable Image Classification and Similarity Discovery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14340.pdf)
>  In this paper, we introduce ProtoPShare, a self-explained method that incorporates the paradigm of prototypical parts to explain its predictions. The main novelty of the ProtoPShare is its ability to efficiently share prototypical parts between the classes thanks to our data-dependent merge-pruning. Moreover, the prototypes are more consistent and the model is more robust to image perturbations than the state of the art method ProtoPNet. We verify our findings on two datasets, the CUB-200-2011 and the Stanford Cars.      
### 70.BSNet: Bi-Similarity Network for Few-shot Fine-grained Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14311.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning for fine-grained image classification has gained recent attention in computer vision. Among the approaches for few-shot learning, due to the simplicity and effectiveness, metric-based methods are favorably state-of-the-art on many tasks. Most of the metric-based methods assume a single similarity measure and thus obtain a single feature space. However, if samples can simultaneously be well classified via two distinct similarity measures, the samples within a class can distribute more compactly in a smaller feature space, producing more discriminative feature maps. Motivated by this, we propose a so-called \textit{Bi-Similarity Network} (\textit{BSNet}) that consists of a single embedding module and a bi-similarity module of two similarity measures. After the support images and the query images pass through the convolution-based embedding module, the bi-similarity module learns feature maps according to two similarity measures of diverse characteristics. In this way, the model is enabled to learn more discriminative and less similarity-biased features from few shots of fine-grained images, such that the model generalization ability can be significantly improved. Through extensive experiments by slightly modifying established metric/similarity based networks, we show that the proposed approach produces a substantial improvement on several fine-grained image benchmark datasets.

### 71.Image-based plant disease diagonasis with unsupervised anomaly detection based on reconstructability of colors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14306.pdf)
>  This paper proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection technique for image-based plant disease diagnosis. A construction of large and openly available data set on labeled images of healthy and diseased crop plants has led to growing interest in computer vision techniques for plant disease diagnosis. Although supervised image classifiers based on deep learning could be a powerful tool to identify plant diseases, they require huge amount of data set that have been labeled as healthy and disease. While, data mining techniques called anomaly detection includes unsupervised approaches that not require rare samples for training classifiers The proposed method in this study focuses on the reconstructability of colors on plant images. We expect that a deep encoder decoder network trained for reconstructing colors of healthy plant images fails to color symptomatic regions. The main contributions of this work are as follows: (i) we propose a new image-based plant disease detection framework utilising a conditional adversarial network called pix2pix,(ii) we introduce a new anomaly score calculated from CIEDE2000 color difference. Through experiments using the PlantVillage dataset, we demonstrate that our method is superior to an existing anomaly detector called AnoGAN for identifying diseased crop images in terms of accuracy, interpretability and computational efficiency.      
### 72.Multistage Attention ResU-Net for Semantic Segmentation of Fine-Resolution Remote Sensing Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14302.pdf)
>  The memory and computation costs of the dot-product attention mechanism widely used in vision and language tasks increase quadratically with the spatio-temporal size of the input. Such growth hinders the usage of attention mechanisms in application scenarios with large inputs. In this Letter, to remedy this deficiency, we propose a Linear Attention Mechanism (LAM) which is approximate to dot-product attention with dramatically less memory and computation costs. The efficient design makes the incorporation between attention mechanisms and neural networks more flexible and versatile. Based on the proposed LAM, we refactor the skip connections in the raw U-Net and design a Multistage Attention ResU-Net (MAResU-Net) for semantic segmentation using fine-resolution remote sensing images. Experiments conducted on the Vaihingen dataset demonstrated the effectiveness of our MAResU-Net. Code is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/lironui/Multistage-Attention-ResU-Net" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 73.A method for large diffeomorphic registration via broken geodesics  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14298.pdf)
>  Anatomical variabilities seen in longitudinal data or inter-subject data is usually described by the underlying deformation, captured by non-rigid registration of these images. Stationary Velocity Field (SVF) based non-rigid registration algorithms are widely used for registration. SVF based methods form a metric-free framework which captures a finite dimensional submanifold of deformations embedded in the infinite dimensional smooth manifold of diffeomorphisms. However, these methods cover only a limited degree of deformations. In this paper, we address this limitation and define an approximate metric space for the manifold of diffeomorphisms $\mathcal{G}$. We propose a method to break down the large deformation into finite compositions of small deformations. This results in a broken geodesic path on $\mathcal{G}$ and its length now forms an approximate registration metric. We illustrate the method using a simple, intensity-based, log-demon implementation. Validation results of the proposed method show that it can capture large and complex deformations while producing qualitatively better results than the state-of-the-art methods. The results also demonstrate that the proposed registration metric is a good indicator of the degree of deformation.      
### 74.Learning geometry-image representation for 3D point cloud generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14289.pdf)
>  We study the problem of generating point clouds of 3D objects. Instead of discretizing the object into 3D voxels with huge computational cost and resolution limitations, we propose a novel geometry image based generator (GIG) to convert the 3D point cloud generation problem to a 2D geometry image generation problem. Since the geometry image is a completely regular 2D array that contains the surface points of the 3D object, it leverages both the regularity of the 2D array and the geodesic neighborhood of the 3D surface. Thus, one significant benefit of our GIG is that it allows us to directly generate the 3D point clouds using efficient 2D image generation networks. Experiments on both rigid and non-rigid 3D object datasets have demonstrated the promising performance of our method to not only create plausible and novel 3D objects, but also learn a probabilistic latent space that well supports the shape editing like interpolation and arithmetic.      
### 75.Learning Affinity-Aware Upsampling for Deep Image Matting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14288.pdf)
>  We show that learning affinity in upsampling provides an effective and efficient approach to exploit pairwise interactions in deep networks. Second-order features are commonly used in dense prediction to build adjacent relations with a learnable module after upsampling such as non-local blocks. Since upsampling is essential, learning affinity in upsampling can avoid additional propagation layers, offering the potential for building compact models. By looking at existing upsampling operators from a unified mathematical perspective, we generalize them into a second-order form and introduce Affinity-Aware Upsampling (A2U) where upsampling kernels are generated using a light-weight lowrank bilinear model and are conditioned on second-order features. Our upsampling operator can also be extended to downsampling. We discuss alternative implementations of A2U and verify their effectiveness on two detail-sensitive tasks: image reconstruction on a toy dataset; and a largescale image matting task where affinity-based ideas constitute mainstream matting approaches. In particular, results on the Composition-1k matting dataset show that A2U achieves a 14% relative improvement in the SAD metric against a strong baseline with negligible increase of parameters (&lt;0.5%). Compared with the state-of-the-art matting network, we achieve 8% higher performance with only 40% model complexity.      
### 76.Deeper or Wider Networks of Point Clouds with Self-attention?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14285.pdf)
>  Prevalence of deeper networks driven by self-attention is in stark contrast to underexplored point-based methods. In this paper, we propose groupwise self-attention as the basic block to construct our network: SepNet. Our proposed module can effectively capture both local and global dependencies. This module computes the features of a group based on the summation of the weighted features of any point within the group. For convenience, we generalize groupwise operations to assemble this module. To further facilitate our networks, we deepen and widen SepNet on the tasks of segmentation and classification respectively, and verify its practicality. Specifically, SepNet achieves state-of-the-art for the tasks of classification and segmentation on most of the datasets. We show empirical evidence that SepNet can obtain extra accuracy in classification or segmentation from increased width or depth, respectively.      
### 77.UVid-Net: Enhanced Semantic Segmentation of UAV Aerial Videos by Embedding Temporal Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14284.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation of aerial videos has been extensively used for decision making in monitoring environmental changes, urban planning, and disaster management. The reliability of these decision support systems is dependent on the accuracy of the video semantic segmentation algorithms. The existing CNN based video semantic segmentation methods have enhanced the image semantic segmentation methods by incorporating an additional module such as LSTM or optical flow for computing temporal dynamics of the video which is a computational overhead. The proposed research work modifies the CNN architecture by incorporating temporal information to improve the efficiency of video semantic segmentation. <br>In this work, an enhanced encoder-decoder based CNN architecture (UVid-Net) is proposed for UAV video semantic segmentation. The encoder of the proposed architecture embeds temporal information for temporally consistent labelling. The decoder is enhanced by introducing the feature retainer module, which aids in the accurate localization of the class labels. The proposed UVid-Net architecture for UAV video semantic segmentation is quantitatively evaluated on an extended ManipalUAVid dataset. The performance metric mIoU of 0.79 has been observed which is significantly greater than the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further, the proposed work produced promising results even for the pre-trained model of UVid-Net on the urban street scene with fine-tuning the final layer on UAV aerial videos.      
### 78.Multi-task GANs for Semantic Segmentation and Depth Completion with Cycle Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14272.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation and depth completion are two challenging tasks in scene understanding, and they are widely used in robotics and autonomous driving. Although several works are proposed to jointly train these two tasks using some small modifications, like changing the last layer, the result of one task is not utilized to improve the performance of the other one despite that there are some similarities between these two tasks. In this paper, we propose multi-task generative adversarial networks (Multi-task GANs), which are not only competent in semantic segmentation and depth completion, but also improve the accuracy of depth completion through generated semantic images. In addition, we improve the details of generated semantic images based on CycleGAN by introducing multi-scale spatial pooling blocks and the structural similarity reconstruction loss. Furthermore, considering the inner consistency between semantic and geometric structures, we develop a semantic-guided smoothness loss to improve depth completion results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes dataset and KITTI depth completion benchmark show that the Multi-task GANs are capable of achieving competitive performance for both semantic segmentation and depth completion tasks.      
### 79.FaceGuard: A Self-Supervised Defense Against Adversarial Face Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14218.pdf)
>  Prevailing defense mechanisms against adversarial face images tend to overfit to the adversarial perturbations in the training set and fail to generalize to unseen adversarial attacks. We propose a new self-supervised adversarial defense framework, namely FaceGuard, that can automatically detect, localize, and purify a wide variety of adversarial faces without utilizing pre-computed adversarial training samples. During training, FaceGuard automatically synthesizes challenging and diverse adversarial attacks, enabling a classifier to learn to distinguish them from real faces and a purifier attempts to remove the adversarial perturbations in the image space. Experimental results on LFW dataset show that FaceGuard can achieve 99.81% detection accuracy on six unseen adversarial attack types. In addition, the proposed method can enhance the face recognition performance of ArcFace from 34.27% TAR @ 0.1% FAR under no defense to 77.46% TAR @ 0.1% FAR.      
### 80.Truly shift-invariant convolutional neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14214.pdf)
>  Thanks to the use of convolution and pooling layers, convolutional neural networks were for a long time thought to be shift-invariant. However, recent works have shown that the output of a CNN can change significantly with small shifts in input: a problem caused by the presence of downsampling (stride) layers. The existing solutions rely either on data augmentation or on anti-aliasing, both of which have limitations and neither of which enables perfect shift invariance. Additionally, the gains obtained from these methods do not extend to image patterns not seen during training. To address these challenges, we propose adaptive polyphase sampling (APS), a simple sub-sampling scheme that allows convolutional neural networks to achieve 100% consistency in classification performance under shifts, without any loss in accuracy. With APS the networks exhibit perfect consistency to shifts even before training, making it the first approach that makes convolutional neural networks truly shift invariant.      
### 81.Class-agnostic Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14204.pdf)
>  Object detection models perform well at localizing and classifying objects that they are shown during training. However, due to the difficulty and cost associated with creating and annotating detection datasets, trained models detect a limited number of object types with unknown objects treated as background content. This hinders the adoption of conventional detectors in real-world applications like large-scale object matching, visual grounding, visual relation prediction, obstacle detection (where it is more important to determine the presence and location of objects than to find specific types), etc. We propose class-agnostic object detection as a new problem that focuses on detecting objects irrespective of their object-classes. Specifically, the goal is to predict bounding boxes for all objects in an image but not their object-classes. The predicted boxes can then be consumed by another system to perform application-specific classification, retrieval, etc. We propose training and evaluation protocols for benchmarking class-agnostic detectors to advance future research in this domain. Finally, we propose (1) baseline methods and (2) a new adversarial learning framework for class-agnostic detection that forces the model to exclude class-specific information from features used for predictions. Experimental results show that adversarial learning improves class-agnostic detection efficacy.      
### 82.E-Pro: Euler Angle and Probabilistic Model for Face Detection and Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14200.pdf)
>  It is human nature to give prime importance to facial appearances. Often, to look good is to feel good. Also, facial features are unique to every individual on this planet, which means it is a source of vital information. This work proposes a framework named E-Pro for the detection and recognition of faces by taking facial images as inputs. E-Pro has its potential application in various domains, namely attendance, surveillance, crowd monitoring, biometric-based authentication etc. E-Pro is developed here as a mobile application that aims to aid lecturers to mark attendance in a classroom by detecting and recognizing the faces of students from a picture clicked through the app. E-Pro has been developed using Google Firebase Face Recognition APIs, which uses Euler Angles, and Probabilistic Model. E-Pro has been tested on stock images and the experimental results are promising.      
### 83.Towards Robust Medical Image Segmentation on Small-Scale Data with Incomplete Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14164.pdf)
>  The data-driven nature of deep learning models for semantic segmentation requires a large number of pixel-level annotations. However, large-scale and fully labeled medical datasets are often unavailable for practical tasks. Recently, partially supervised methods have been proposed to utilize images with incomplete labels to mitigate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. As an emerging research area, the breakthroughs made by existing methods rely on either large-scale data or complex model design, which makes them 1) less practical for certain real-life tasks and 2) less robust for small-scale data. It is time to step back and think about the robustness of partially supervised methods and how to maximally utilize small-scale and partially labeled data for medical image segmentation tasks. To bridge the methodological gaps in label-efficient deep learning with partial supervision, we propose RAMP, a simple yet efficient data augmentation framework for partially supervised medical image segmentation by exploiting the assumption that patients share anatomical similarities. We systematically evaluate RAMP and the previous methods in various controlled multi-structure segmentation tasks. Compared to the mainstream approaches, RAMP consistently improves the performance of traditional segmentation networks on small-scale partially labeled data and utilize additional image-wise weak annotations.      
### 84.Batch Normalization with Enhanced Linear Transformation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14150.pdf)
>  Batch normalization (BN) is a fundamental unit in modern deep networks, in which a linear transformation module was designed for improving BN's flexibility of fitting complex data distributions. In this paper, we demonstrate properly enhancing this linear transformation module can effectively improve the ability of BN. Specifically, rather than using a single neuron, we propose to additionally consider each neuron's neighborhood for calculating the outputs of the linear transformation. Our method, named BNET, can be implemented with 2-3 lines of code in most deep learning libraries. Despite the simplicity, BNET brings consistent performance gains over a wide range of backbones and visual benchmarks. Moreover, we verify that BNET accelerates the convergence of network training and enhances spatial information by assigning the important neurons with larger weights accordingly.

### 85.i3DMM: Deep Implicit 3D Morphable Model of Human Heads  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14143.pdf)
>  We present the first deep implicit 3D morphable model (i3DMM) of full heads. Unlike earlier morphable face models it not only captures identity-specific geometry, texture, and expressions of the frontal face, but also models the entire head, including hair. We collect a new dataset consisting of 64 people with different expressions and hairstyles to train i3DMM. Our approach has the following favorable properties: (i) It is the first full head morphable model that includes hair. (ii) In contrast to mesh-based models it can be trained on merely rigidly aligned scans, without requiring difficult non-rigid registration. (iii) We design a novel architecture to decouple the shape model into an implicit reference shape and a deformation of this reference shape. With that, dense correspondences between shapes can be learned implicitly. (iv) This architecture allows us to semantically disentangle the geometry and color components, as color is learned in the reference space. Geometry is further disentangled as identity, expressions, and hairstyle, while color is disentangled as identity and hairstyle components. We show the merits of i3DMM using ablation studies, comparisons to state-of-the-art models, and applications such as semantic head editing and texture transfer. We will make our model publicly available.      
### 86.AdaBins: Depth Estimation using Adaptive Bins  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14141.pdf)
>  We address the problem of estimating a high quality dense depth map from a single RGB input image. We start out with a baseline encoder-decoder convolutional neural network architecture and pose the question of how the global processing of information can help improve overall depth estimation. To this end, we propose a transformer-based architecture block that divides the depth range into bins whose center value is estimated adaptively per image. The final depth values are estimated as linear combinations of the bin centers. We call our new building block AdaBins. Our results show a decisive improvement over the state-of-the-art on several popular depth datasets across all metrics. We also validate the effectiveness of the proposed block with an ablation study and provide the code and corresponding pre-trained weights of the new state-of-the-art model.      
### 87.Towards Fast and Light-Weight Restoration of Dark Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14133.pdf)
>  The ability to capture good quality images in the dark and near-zero lux conditions has been a long-standing pursuit of the computer vision community. The seminal work by Chen et al. [5] has especially caused renewed interest in this area, resulting in methods that build on top of their work in a bid to improve the reconstruction. However, for practical utility and deployment of low-light enhancement algorithms on edge devices such as embedded systems, surveillance cameras, autonomous robots and smartphones, the solution must respect additional constraints such as limited GPU memory and processing power. With this in mind, we propose a deep neural network architecture that aims to strike a balance between the network latency, memory utilization, model parameters, and reconstruction quality. The key idea is to forbid computations in the High-Resolution (HR) space and limit them to a Low-Resolution (LR) space. However, doing the bulk of computations in the LR space causes artifacts in the restored image. We thus propose Pack and UnPack operations, which allow us to effectively transit between the HR and LR spaces without incurring much artifacts in the restored image. We show that we can enhance a full resolution, 2848 x 4256, extremely dark single-image in the ballpark of 3 seconds even on a CPU. We achieve this with 2 - 7x fewer model parameters, 2 - 3x lower memory utilization, 5 - 20x speed up and yet maintain a competitive image reconstruction quality compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.      
### 88.Hijack-GAN: Unintended-Use of Pretrained, Black-Box GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14107.pdf)
>  While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) show increasing performance and the level of realism is becoming indistinguishable from natural images, this also comes with high demands on data and computation. We show that state-of-the-art GAN models -- such as they are being publicly released by researchers and industry -- can be used for a range of applications beyond unconditional image generation. We achieve this by an iterative scheme that also allows gaining control over the image generation process despite the highly non-linear latent spaces of the latest GAN models. We demonstrate that this opens up the possibility to re-use state-of-the-art, difficult to train, pre-trained GANs with a high level of control even if only black-box access is granted. Our work also raises concerns and awareness that the use cases of a published GAN model may well reach beyond the creators' intention, which needs to be taken into account before a full public release.      
### 89.Let's Hope it Works! Inaccurate Supervision of Neural Networks with Incorrect Labels: Application to Epilepsy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14101.pdf)
>  This work describes multiple weak supervision strategies for video processing with neural networks in the context of epilepsy. To study seizure onset, researchers have designed automated methods to detect seizures from electroencephalography (EEG), a modality used for recording electrical brain activity. However, the EEG signal alone is sometimes not enough for existing detection methods to discriminate seizure from artifacts having a similar signal on EEG. For example, such artifacts could be triggered by patting, rocking or suctioning in the case of neonates. In this article, we addressed this problem by automatically detecting an example artifact-patting of neonates -- from continuous video recordings of neonates acquired during clinical routine. We computed frame-to-frame cross-correlation matrices to isolate patterns showing repetitive movements indicative of patting. Next, a convolutional neural network was trained to classify whether these matrices contained patting events using weak training labels -- noisy labels generated during normal clinical procedure. The labels were considered weak as they were sometimes incorrect. We investigated whether networks trained with more samples, containing more uncertain and weak labels, could achieve a higher performance. Our results showed that, in the case of patting detection, such networks could achieve a higher recall and focused on areas of the cross-correlation matrices that were more meaningful to the task, without sacrificing precision.      
### 90.Movement Tracks for the Automatic Detection of Fish Behavior in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14070.pdf)
>  Global warming is predicted to profoundly impact ocean ecosystems. Fish behavior is an important indicator of changes in such marine environments. Thus, the automatic identification of key fish behavior in videos represents a much needed tool for marine researchers, enabling them to study climate change-related phenomena. We offer a dataset of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) startle behaviors in underwater videos, and investigate the use of deep learning (DL) methods for behavior detection on it. Our proposed detection system identifies fish instances using DL-based frameworks, determines trajectory tracks, derives novel behavior-specific features, and employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to identify startle behavior in sablefish. Its performance is studied by comparing it with a state-of-the-art DL-based video event detector.      
### 91.Efficient Attention Network: Accelerate Attention by Searching Where to Plug  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14058.pdf)
>  Recently, many plug-and-play self-attention modules are proposed to enhance the model generalization by exploiting the internal information of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Previous works lay an emphasis on the design of attention module for specific functionality, e.g., light-weighted or task-oriented attention. However, they ignore the importance of where to plug in the attention module since they connect the modules individually with each block of the entire CNN backbone for granted, leading to incremental computational cost and number of parameters with the growth of network depth. Thus, we propose a framework called Efficient Attention Network (EAN) to improve the efficiency for the existing attention modules. In EAN, we leverage the sharing mechanism (Huang et al. 2020) to share the attention module within the backbone and search where to connect the shared attention module via reinforcement learning. Finally, we obtain the attention network with sparse connections between the backbone and modules, while (1) maintaining accuracy (2) reducing extra parameter increment and (3) accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks and popular attention networks show the effectiveness of EAN. Furthermore, we empirically illustrate that our EAN has the capacity of transferring to other tasks and capturing the informative features.

### 92.Uncertainty-Aware Physically-Guided Proxy Tasks for Unseen Domain Face Anti-spoofing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14054.pdf)
>  Face anti-spoofing (FAS) seeks to discriminate genuine faces from fake ones arising from any type of spoofing attack. Due to the wide varieties of attacks, it is implausible to obtain training data that spans all attack types. We propose to leverage physical cues to attain better generalization on unseen domains. As a specific demonstration, we use physically guided proxy cues such as depth, reflection, and material to complement our main anti-spoofing (a.k.a liveness detection) task, with the intuition that genuine faces across domains have consistent face-like geometry, minimal reflection, and skin material. We introduce a novel uncertainty-aware attention scheme that independently learns to weigh the relative contributions of the main and proxy tasks, preventing the over-confident issue with traditional attention modules. Further, we propose attribute-assisted hard negative mining to disentangle liveness-irrelevant features with liveness features during learning. We evaluate extensively on public benchmarks with intra-dataset and inter-dataset protocols. Our method achieves the superior performance especially in unseen domain generalization for FAS.      
### 93.cMinMax: A Fast Algorithm to Find the Corners of an N-dimensional Convex Polytope  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14035.pdf)
>  During the last years, the emerging field of Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality (AR-VR) has seen tremendousgrowth. At the same time there is a trend to develop low cost high-quality AR systems where computing poweris in demand. Feature points are extensively used in these real-time frame-rate and 3D applications, thereforeefficient high-speed feature detectors are necessary. Corners are such special features and often are used as thefirst step in the marker alignment in Augmented Reality (AR). Corners are also used in image registration andrecognition, tracking, SLAM, robot path finding and 2D or 3D object detection and retrieval. Therefore thereis a large number of corner detection algorithms but most of them are too computationally intensive for use inreal-time applications of any complexity. Many times the border of the image is a convex polygon. For thisspecial, but quite common case, we have developed a specific algorithm, cMinMax. The proposed algorithmis faster, approximately by a factor of 5 compared to the widely used Harris Corner Detection algorithm. Inaddition is highly parallelizable. The algorithm is suitable for the fast registration of markers in augmentedreality systems and in applications where a computationally efficient real time feature detector is necessary.The algorithm can also be extended to N-dimensional polyhedrons.      
### 94.General Multi-label Image Classification with Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14027.pdf)
>  Multi-label image classification is the task of predicting a set of labels corresponding to objects, attributes or other entities present in an image. In this work we propose the Classification Transformer (C-Tran), a general framework for multi-label image classification that leverages Transformers to exploit the complex dependencies among visual features and labels. Our approach consists of a Transformer encoder trained to predict a set of target labels given an input set of masked labels, and visual features from a convolutional neural network. A key ingredient of our method is a label mask training objective that uses a ternary encoding scheme to represent the state of the labels as positive, negative, or unknown during training. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets such as COCO and Visual Genome. Moreover, because our model explicitly represents the uncertainty of labels during training, it is more general by allowing us to produce improved results for images with partial or extra label annotations during inference. We demonstrate this additional capability in the COCO, Visual Genome, News500, and CUB image datasets.      
### 95.Rethinking Text Segmentation: A Novel Dataset and A Text-Specific Refinement Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14021.pdf)
>  Text segmentation is a prerequisite in many real-world text-related tasks, e.g., text style transfer, and scene text removal. However, facing the lack of high-quality datasets and dedicated investigations, this critical prerequisite has been left as an assumption in many works, and has been largely overlooked by current research. To bridge this gap, we proposed TextSeg, a large-scale fine-annotated text dataset with six types of annotations: word- and character-wise bounding polygons, masks and transcriptions. We also introduce Text Refinement Network (TexRNet), a novel text segmentation approach that adapts to the unique properties of text, e.g. non-convex boundary, diverse texture, etc., which often impose burdens on traditional segmentation models. In our TexRNet, we propose text specific network designs to address such challenges, including key features pooling and attention-based similarity checking. We also introduce trimap and discriminator losses that show significant improvement on text segmentation. Extensive experiments are carried out on both our TextSeg dataset and other existing datasets. We demonstrate that TexRNet consistently improves text segmentation performance by nearly 2% compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

### 96.Assessing Post-Disaster Damage from Satellite Imagery using Semi-Supervised Learning Techniques  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14004.pdf)
>  To respond to disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, and armed conflicts, humanitarian organizations require accurate and timely data in the form of damage assessments, which indicate what buildings and population centers have been most affected. Recent research combines machine learning with remote sensing to automatically extract such information from satellite imagery, reducing manual labor and turn-around time. A major impediment to using machine learning methods in real disaster response scenarios is the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient amount of labeled data to train a model for an unfolding disaster. This paper shows a novel application of semi-supervised learning (SSL) to train models for damage assessment with a minimal amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art SSL methods, including MixMatch and FixMatch, to a supervised baseline for the 2010 Haiti earthquake, 2017 Santa Rosa wildfire, and 2016 armed conflict in Syria. We show how models trained with SSL methods can reach fully supervised performance despite using only a fraction of labeled data and identify areas for further improvements.      
### 97.Self supervised contrastive learning for digital histopathology  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13971.pdf)
>  Unsupervised learning has been a long-standing goal of machine learning and is especially important for medical image analysis, where the learning can compensate for the scarcity of labeled datasets. A promising subclass of unsupervised learning is self-supervised learning, which aims to learn salient features using the raw input as the learning signal. In this paper, we use a contrastive self-supervised learning method Chen et al. (2020a) that achieved state-of-the-art results on natural-scene images, and apply this method to digital histopathology by collecting and training on 60 histopathology datasets without any labels. We find that combining multiple multi-organ datasets with different types of staining and resolution properties improves the quality of the learned features. Furthermore, we find drastically subsampling a dataset (e.g., using ? 1% of the available image patches) does not negatively impact the learned representations, unlike training on natural-scene images. Linear classifiers trained on top of the learned features show that networks pretrained on digital histopathology datasets perform better than ImageNet pretrained networks, boosting task performances up to 7.5% in accuracy and 8.9% in F1. These findings may also be useful when applying newer contrastive techniques to histopathology data.

### 98.D-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13961.pdf)
>  Neural rendering techniques combining machine learning with geometric reasoning have arisen as one of the most promising approaches for synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of images. Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \emph{single} camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamic scenes dataset will be released.      
### 99.A Recurrent Vision-and-Language BERT for Navigation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13922.pdf)
>  Accuracy of many visiolinguistic tasks has benefited significantly from the application of vision-and-language (V&amp;L) BERT. However, its application for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) remains limited. One reason for this is the difficulty adapting the BERT architecture to the partially observable Markov decision process present in VLN, requiring history-dependent attention and decision making. In this paper we propose a recurrent BERT model that is time-aware for use in VLN. Specifically, we equip the BERT model with a recurrent function that maintains cross-modal state information for the agent. Through extensive experiments on R2R and REVERIE we demonstrate that our model can replace more complex encoder-decoder models to achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to other transformer-based architectures, supports pre-training, and is capable of multi-task learning suggesting the potential to merge a wide range of BERT-like models for other vision and language tasks.      
### 100.Multimodal Pretraining Unmasked: Unifying the Vision and Language BERTs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15124.pdf)
>  Large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning is now the standard methodology for many tasks in computer vision and natural language processing. Recently, a multitude of methods have been proposed for pretraining vision and language BERTs to tackle challenges at the intersection of these two key areas of AI. These models can be categorized into either single-stream or dual-stream encoders. We study the differences between these two categories, and show how they can be unified under a single theoretical framework. We then conduct controlled experiments to discern the empirical differences between five V&amp;L BERTs. Our experiments show that training data and hyperparameters are responsible for most of the differences between the reported results, but they also reveal that the embedding layer plays a crucial role in these massive models.      
### 101.UniCon: Universal Neural Controller For Physics-based Character Motion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15119.pdf)
>  The field of physics-based animation is gaining importance due to the increasing demand for realism in video games and films, and has recently seen wide adoption of data-driven techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning (RL), which learn control from (human) demonstrations. While RL has shown impressive results at reproducing individual motions and interactive locomotion, existing methods are limited in their ability to generalize to new motions and their ability to compose a complex motion sequence interactively. In this paper, we propose a physics-based universal neural controller (UniCon) that learns to master thousands of motions with different styles by learning on large-scale motion datasets. UniCon is a two-level framework that consists of a high-level motion scheduler and an RL-powered low-level motion executor, which is our key innovation. By systematically analyzing existing multi-motion RL frameworks, we introduce a novel objective function and training techniques which make a significant leap in performance. Once trained, our motion executor can be combined with different high-level schedulers without the need for retraining, enabling a variety of real-time interactive applications. We show that UniCon can support keyboard-driven control, compose motion sequences drawn from a large pool of locomotion and acrobatics skills and teleport a person captured on video to a physics-based virtual avatar. Numerical and qualitative results demonstrate a significant improvement in efficiency, robustness and generalizability of UniCon over prior state-of-the-art, showcasing transferability to unseen motions, unseen humanoid models and unseen perturbation.      
### 102.Learning by Passing Tests, with Application to Neural Architecture Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15102.pdf)
>  Learning through tests is a broadly used methodology in human learning and shows great effectiveness in improving learning outcome: a sequence of tests are made with increasing levels of difficulty; the learner takes these tests to identify his/her weak points in learning and continuously addresses these weak points to successfully pass these tests. We are interested in investigating whether this powerful learning technique can be borrowed from humans to improve the learning abilities of machines. We propose a novel learning approach called learning by passing tests (LPT). In our approach, a tester model creates increasingly more-difficult tests to evaluate a learner model. The learner tries to continuously improve its learning ability so that it can successfully pass however difficult tests created by the tester. We propose a multi-level optimization framework to formulate LPT, where the tester learns to create difficult and meaningful tests and the learner learns to pass these tests. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve the LCT problem. Our method is applied for neural architecture search and achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.      
### 103.Reducing Textural Bias Improves Robustness of Deep Segmentation CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15093.pdf)
>  Despite current advances in deep learning, domain shift remains a common problem in medical imaging settings. Recent findings on natural images suggest that deep neural models can show a textural bias when carrying out image classification tasks, which goes against the common understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) recognising objects through increasingly complex representations of shape. This study draws inspiration from recent findings on natural images and aims to investigate ways in which addressing the textural bias phenomenon could be used to bring up the robustness and transferability of deep segmentation models when applied to three-dimensional (3D) medical data. To achieve this, publicly available MRI scans from the Developing Human Connectome Project are used to investigate ways in which simulating textural noise can help train robust models in a complex segmentation task. Our findings illustrate how applying specific types of textural filters prior to training the models can increase their ability to segment scans corrupted by previously unseen noise.      
### 104.Long-range medical image registration through generalized mutual information (GMI): toward a fully automatic volumetric alignment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15049.pdf)
>  Image registration is a key operation in medical image processing, allowing a plethora of applications. Mutual information (MI) is consolidated as a robust similarity metric often used for medical image registration. Although MI provides a robust medical image registration, it usually fails when the needed image transform is too big due to MI local maxima traps. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a generalized parametric MI as an affine registration cost function. We assessed the generalized MI (GMI) functions for separable affine transforms and exhaustively evaluated the GMI mathematical image seeking the maximum registration range through a gradient descent simulation. We also employed Monte Carlo simulation essays for testing translation registering of randomized T1 versus T2 images. GMI functions showed to have smooth isosurfaces driving the algorithm to the global maxima. Results show significantly prolonged registration ranges, avoiding the traps of local maxima. We evaluated a range of [-150mm,150mm] for translations, [-180°,180°] for rotations, [0.5,2] for scales, and [-1,1] for skew with a success rate of 99.99%, 97.58%, 99.99%, and 99.99% respectively for the transforms in the simulated gradient descent. We also obtained 99.75% success in Monte Carlo simulation from 2,000 randomized translations trials with 1,113 subjects T1 and T2 MRI images. The findings point towards the reliability of GMI for long-range registration with enhanced speed performance      
### 105.Unsupervised Deep Video Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15045.pdf)
>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) currently achieve state-of-the-art performance in denoising videos. They are typically trained with supervision, minimizing the error between the network output and ground-truth clean videos. However, in many applications, such as microscopy, noiseless videos are not available. To address these cases, we build on recent advances in unsupervised still image denoising to develop an Unsupervised Deep Video Denoiser (UDVD). UDVD is shown to perform competitively with current state-of-the-art supervised methods on benchmark datasets, even when trained only on a single short noisy video sequence. Experiments on fluorescence-microscopy and electron-microscopy data illustrate the promise of our approach for imaging modalities where ground-truth clean data is generally not available. In addition, we study the mechanisms used by trained CNNs to perform video denoising. An analysis of the gradient of the network output with respect to its input reveals that these networks perform spatio-temporal filtering that is adapted to the particular spatial structures and motion of the underlying content. We interpret this as an implicit and highly effective form of motion compensation, a widely used paradigm in traditional video denoising, compression, and analysis. Code and iPython notebooks for our analysis are available in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://sreyas-mohan.github.io/udvd/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> .      
### 106.Image Quality Assessment for Perceptual Image Restoration: A New Dataset, Benchmark and Metric  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.15002.pdf)
>  Image quality assessment (IQA) is the key factor for the fast development of image restoration (IR) algorithms. The most recent perceptual IR algorithms based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have brought in significant improvement on visual performance, but also pose great challenges for quantitative evaluation. Notably, we observe an increasing inconsistency between perceptual quality and the evaluation results. We present two questions: Can existing IQA methods objectively evaluate recent IR algorithms? With the focus on beating current benchmarks, are we getting better IR algorithms? To answer the questions and promote the development of IQA methods, we contribute a large-scale IQA dataset, called Perceptual Image Processing ALgorithms (PIPAL) dataset. Especially, this dataset includes the results of GAN-based IR algorithms, which are missing in previous datasets. We collect more than 1.13 million human judgments to assign subjective scores for PIPAL images using the more reliable Elo system. Based on PIPAL, we present new benchmarks for both IQA and SR methods. Our results indicate that existing IQA methods cannot fairly evaluate GAN-based IR algorithms. While using appropriate evaluation methods is important, IQA methods should also be updated along with the development of IR algorithms. At last, we shed light on how to improve the IQA performance on GAN-based distortion. Inspired by the find that the existing IQA methods have an unsatisfactory performance on the GAN-based distortion partially because of their low tolerance to spatial misalignment, we propose to improve the performance of an IQA network on GAN-based distortion by explicitly considering this misalignment. We propose the Space Warping Difference Network, which includes the novel l_2 pooling layers and Space Warping Difference layers. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.      
### 107.MAVIDH Score: A Corona Severity Scoring using Interpretable Chest X-Ray Pathology Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14983.pdf)
>  The application of computer vision for COVID-19 diagnosis is complex and challenging, given the risks associated with patient misclassifications. Arguably, the primary value of medical imaging for COVID-19 lies rather on patient prognosis. Radiological images can guide physicians assessing the severity of the disease, and a series of images from the same patient at different stages can help to gauge disease progression. Based on these premises, a simple method based on lung-pathology features for scoring disease severity from Chest X-rays is proposed here. As the primary contribution, this method shows to be correlated to patient severity in different stages of disease progression comparatively well when contrasted with other existing methods. An original approach for data selection is also proposed, allowing the simple model to learn the severity-related features. It is hypothesized that the resulting competitive performance presented here is related to the method being feature-based rather than reliant on lung involvement or compromise as others in the literature. The fact that it is simpler and interpretable than other end-to-end, more complex models, also sets aside this work. As the data set is small, bias-inducing artifacts that could lead to overfitting are minimized through an image normalization and lung segmentation step at the learning phase. A second contribution comes from the validation of the results, conceptualized as the scoring of patients groups from different stages of the disease. Besides performing such validation on an independent data set, the results were also compared with other proposed scoring methods in the literature. The expressive results show that although imaging alone is not sufficient for assessing severity as a whole, there is a strong correlation with the scoring system, termed as MAVIDH score, with patient outcome.      
### 108.Handling Noisy Labels via One-Step Abductive Multi-Target Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14956.pdf)
>  Learning from noisy labels is an important concern because of the lack of accurate ground-truth labels in plenty of real-world scenarios. In practice, various approaches for this concern first make corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances, and then update predictive model with information of the made corrections. However, in specific areas, such as medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA), it is often difficult or even impossible for experts to manually achieve the noisy-free ground-truth labels which leads to labels with heavy noise. This situation raises two more difficult problems: 1) the methodology of approaches making corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances has limitations due to the heavy noise existing in labels; and 2) the appropriate evaluation strategy for validation/testing is unclear because of the great difficulty in collecting the noisy-free ground-truth labels. In this paper, we focus on alleviating these two problems. For the problem 1), we present a one-step abductive multi-target learning framework (OSAMTLF) that imposes a one-step logical reasoning upon machine learning via a multi-target learning procedure to abduct the predictions of the learning model to be subject to our prior knowledge. For the problem 2), we propose a logical assessment formula (LAF) that evaluates the logical rationality of the outputs of an approach by estimating the consistencies between the predictions of the learning model and the logical facts narrated from the results of the one-step logical reasoning of OSAMTLF. Applying OSAMTLF and LAF to the Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) segmentation task in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTLF is able to abduct the machine learning model achieving logically more rational predictions, which is beyond the capability of various state-of-the-art approaches for learning from noisy labels.      
### 109.Image Denoising for Strong Gaussian Noises With Specialized CNNs for Different Frequency Components  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14908.pdf)
>  In machine learning approach to image denoising a network is trained to recover a clean image from a noisy one. In this paper a novel structure is proposed based on training multiple specialized networks as opposed to existing structures that are base on a single network. The proposed model is an alternative for training a very deep network to avoid issues like vanishing or exploding gradient. By dividing a very deep network into two smaller networks the same number of learnable parameters will be available, but two smaller networks should be trained which are easier to train. Over smoothing and waxy artifacts are major problems with existing methods; because the network tries to keep the Mean Square Error (MSE) low for general structures and details, which leads to overlooking of details. This problem is more severe in the presence of strong noise. To reduce this problem, in the proposed structure, the image is decomposed into its low and high frequency components and each component is used to train a separate denoising convolutional neural network. One network is specialized to reconstruct the general structure of the image and the other one is specialized to reconstruct the details. Results of the proposed method show higher peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), and structural similarity index (SSIM) compared to a popular state of the art denoising method in the presence of strong noises.      
### 110.Language-Driven Region Pointer Advancement for Controllable Image Captioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14901.pdf)
>  Controllable Image Captioning is a recent sub-field in the multi-modal task of Image Captioning wherein constraints are placed on which regions in an image should be described in the generated natural language caption. This puts a stronger focus on producing more detailed descriptions, and opens the door for more end-user control over results. A vital component of the Controllable Image Captioning architecture is the mechanism that decides the timing of attending to each region through the advancement of a region pointer. In this paper, we propose a novel method for predicting the timing of region pointer advancement by treating the advancement step as a natural part of the language structure via a NEXT-token, motivated by a strong correlation to the sentence structure in the training data. We find that our timing agrees with the ground-truth timing in the Flickr30k Entities test data with a precision of 86.55% and a recall of 97.92%. Our model implementing this technique improves the state-of-the-art on standard captioning metrics while additionally demonstrating a considerably larger effective vocabulary size.      
### 111.Uncertainty-driven ensembles of deep architectures for multiclass classification. Application to COVID-19 diagnosis in chest X-ray images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14894.pdf)
>  Respiratory diseases kill million of people each year. Diagnosis of these pathologies is a manual, time-consuming process that has inter and intra-observer variability, delaying diagnosis and treatment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the need of developing systems to automatize the diagnosis of pneumonia, whilst Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) have proved to be an excellent option for the automatic classification of medical images. However, given the need of providing a confidence classification in this context it is crucial to quantify the reliability of the model's predictions. In this work, we propose a multi-level ensemble classification system based on a Bayesian Deep Learning approach in order to maximize performance while quantifying the uncertainty of each classification decision. This tool combines the information extracted from different architectures by weighting their results according to the uncertainty of their predictions. Performance of the Bayesian network is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously differentiating between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19 pneumonia. A three-level decision tree is employed to divide the 4-class classification into three binary classifications, yielding an accuracy of 98.06% and overcoming the results obtained by recent literature. The reduced preprocessing needed for obtaining this high performance, in addition to the information provided about the reliability of the predictions evidence the applicability of the system to be used as an aid for clinicians.      
### 112.Deep Interactive Denoiser (DID) for X-Ray Computed Tomography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14873.pdf)
>  Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) is desirable for both diagnostic imaging and image guided interventions. Denoisers are openly used to improve the quality of LDCT. Deep learning (DL)-based denoisers have shown state-of-the-art performance and are becoming one of the mainstream methods. However, there exists two challenges regarding the DL-based denoisers: 1) a trained model typically does not generate different image candidates with different noise-resolution tradeoffs which sometimes are needed for different clinical tasks; 2) the model generalizability might be an issue when the noise level in the testing images is different from that in the training dataset. To address these two challenges, in this work, we introduce a lightweight optimization process at the testing phase on top of any existing DL-based denoisers to generate multiple image candidates with different noise-resolution tradeoffs suitable for different clinical tasks in real-time. Consequently, our method allows the users to interact with the denoiser to efficiently review various image candidates and quickly pick up the desired one, and thereby was termed as deep interactive denoiser (DID). Experimental results demonstrated that DID can deliver multiple image candidates with different noise-resolution tradeoffs, and shows great generalizability regarding various network architectures, as well as training and testing datasets with various noise levels.      
### 113.ViDi: Descriptive Visual Data Clustering as Radiologist Assistant in COVID-19 Streamline Diagnostic  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14871.pdf)
>  In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, deep learning methods have been widely investigated in detecting COVID-19 from chest X-rays. However, a more pragmatic approach to applying AI methods to a medical diagnosis is designing a framework that facilitates human-machine interaction and expert decision making. Studies have shown that categorization can play an essential rule in accelerating real-world decision making. Inspired by descriptive document clustering, we propose a domain-independent explanatory clustering framework to group contextually related instances and support radiologists' decision making. While most descriptive clustering approaches employ domain-specific characteristics to form meaningful clusters, we focus on model-level explanation as a more general-purpose element of every learning process to achieve cluster homogeneity. We employ DeepSHAP to generate homogeneous clusters in terms of disease severity and describe the clusters using favorable and unfavorable saliency maps, which visualize the class discriminating regions of an image. These human-interpretable maps complement radiologist knowledge to investigate the whole cluster at once. Besides, as part of this study, we evaluate a model based on VGG-19, which can identify COVID and pneumonia cases with a positive predictive value of 95% and 97%, respectively, comparable to the recent explainable approaches for COVID diagnosis.      
### 114.Prior Flow Variational Autoencoder: A density estimation model for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14870.pdf)
>  Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a computational technique to estimate the power loads' appliance-by-appliance from the whole consumption measured by a single meter. In this paper, we propose a conditional density estimation model, based on deep neural networks, that joins a Conditional Variational Autoencoder with a Conditional Invertible Normalizing Flow model to estimate the individual appliance's power demand. The resulting model is called Prior Flow Variational Autoencoder or, for simplicity PFVAE. Thus, instead of having one model per appliance, the resulting model is responsible for estimating the power demand, appliance-by-appliance, at once. We train and evaluate our proposed model in a publicly available dataset composed of power demand measures from a poultry feed factory located in Brazil. The proposed model's quality is evaluated by comparing the obtained normalized disaggregation error (NDE) and signal aggregated error (SAE) with the previous work values on the same dataset. Our proposal achieves highly competitive results, and for six of the eight machines belonging to the dataset, we observe consistent improvements that go from 28% up to 81% in NDE and from 27% up to 86% in SAE.      
### 115.Doubly Stochastic Subspace Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14859.pdf)
>  Many state-of-the-art subspace clustering methods follow a two-step process by first constructing an affinity matrix between data points and then applying spectral clustering to this affinity. Most of the research into these methods focuses on the first step of generating the affinity matrix, which often exploits the self-expressive property of linear subspaces, with little consideration typically given to the spectral clustering step that produces the final clustering. Moreover, existing methods obtain the affinity by applying ad-hoc postprocessing steps to the self-expressive representation of the data, and this postprocessing can have a significant impact on the subsequent spectral clustering step. In this work, we propose to unify these two steps by jointly learning both a self-expressive representation of the data and an affinity matrix that is well-normalized for spectral clustering. In the proposed model, we constrain the affinity matrix to be doubly stochastic, which results in a principled method for affinity matrix normalization while also exploiting the known benefits of doubly stochastic normalization in spectral clustering. While our proposed model is non-convex, we give a convex relaxation that is provably equivalent in many regimes; we also develop an efficient approximation to the full model that works well in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art subspace clustering performance on many common datasets in computer vision.      
### 116.Sparse-View Spectral CT Reconstruction Using Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14842.pdf)
>  Spectral CT is an emerging technology capable of providing high chemical specificity, which is crucial for many applications such as detecting threats in luggage. Such applications often require both fast and high-quality image reconstruction based on sparse-view (few) projections. The conventional FBP method is fast but it produces low-quality images dominated by noise and artifacts when few projections are available. Iterative methods with, e.g., TV regularizers can circumvent that but they are computationally expensive, with the computational load proportionally increasing with the number of spectral channels. Instead, we propose an approach for fast reconstruction of sparse-view spectral CT data using U-Net with multi-channel input and output. The network is trained to output high-quality images from input images reconstructed by FBP. The network is fast at run-time and because the internal convolutions are shared between the channels, the computation load increases only at the first and last layers, making it an efficient approach to process spectral data with a large number of channels. We validated our approach using real CT scans. The results show qualitatively and quantitatively that our approach is able to outperform the state-of-the-art iterative methods. Furthermore, the results indicate that the network is able to exploit the coupling of the channels to enhance the overall quality and robustness.      
### 117.Learning To Find Shortest Collision-Free Paths From Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14787.pdf)
>  Motion planning is a fundamental problem in robotics and machine perception. Sampling-based planners find accurate solutions by exhaustively exploring the space, but are inefficient and tend to produce jerky motions. Optimization and learning-based planners are more efficient and produce smooth trajectories. However, a significant hurdle that these approaches face is constructing a differentiable cost function that simultaneously minimizes path length and avoids collisions. These two objectives are conflicting by nature -- path length is continuous and well-behaved, but collisions are discrete non-differentiable events. Reconciling these terms has been a significant challenge in optimization-based motion planning. The main contribution of this paper is a novel cost function that guarantees collision-free shortest paths are found at its minimum. We show that our approach works seamlessly with RGBD input and predicts high-quality paths in 2D, 3D, and 6 DoF robotic manipulator settings. Our method also reduces training and inference time compared to existing approaches, in some cases by orders of magnitude.      
### 118.Deep learning approach to left ventricular non-compaction measurement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14773.pdf)
>  Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy characterized by abnormal trabeculations in the left ventricle cavity. Although traditional computer vision approaches exist for LVNC diagnosis, deep learning-based tools could not be found in the literature. In this paper, a first approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented. Four CNNs are trained to automatically segment the compacted and trabecular areas of the left ventricle for a population of patients diagnosed with Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Inference results confirm that deep learning-based approaches can achieve excellent results in the diagnosis and measurement of LVNC. The two best CNNs (U-Net and Efficient U-Net B1) perform image segmentation in less than 0.2 s on a CPU and in less than 0.01 s on a GPU. Additionally, a subjective evaluation of the output images with the identified zones is performed by expert cardiologists, with a perfect visual agreement for all the slices, outperforming already existing automatic tools.      
### 119.DRDr II: Detecting the Severity Level of Diabetic Retinopathy Using Mask RCNN and Transfer Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14733.pdf)
>  DRDr II is a hybrid of machine learning and deep learning worlds. It builds on the successes of its antecedent, namely, DRDr, that was trained to detect, locate, and create segmentation masks for two types of lesions (exudates and microaneurysms) that can be found in the eyes of the Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) patients; and uses the entire model as a solid feature extractor in the core of its pipeline to detect the severity level of the DR cases. We employ a big dataset with over 35 thousand fundus images collected from around the globe and after 2 phases of preprocessing alongside feature extraction, we succeed in predicting the correct severity levels with over 92% accuracy.      
### 120.Learning-based lossless compression of 3D point cloud geometry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14700.pdf)
>  This paper presents a learning-based, lossless compression method for static point cloud geometry, based on context-adaptive arithmetic coding. Unlike most existing methods working in the octree domain, our encoder operates in a hybrid mode, mixing octree and voxel-based coding. We adaptively partition the point cloud into multi-resolution voxel blocks according to the point cloud structure and use octree to signal the partitioning. On the one hand, octree representation can eliminate the sparsity in the point cloud. On the other hand, in the voxel domain, convolutions can be naturally expressed, and geometric information (i.e., planes, surfaces, etc.) is explicitly processed by a neural network. Our context model benefits from these properties and learns a probability distribution of the voxels using a deep convolutional neural network with masked filters, called VoxelDNN. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MPEG G-PCC standard with average rate savings of 28% on a diverse set of point clouds from the Microsoft Voxelized Upper Bodies (MVUB) and MPEG.      
### 121.On Initial Pools for Deep Active Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14696.pdf)
>  Active Learning (AL) techniques aim to minimize the training data required to train a model for a given task. Pool-based AL techniques start with a small initial labeled pool and then iteratively pick batches of the most informative samples for labeling. Generally, the initial pool is sampled randomly and labeled to seed the AL iterations. While recent` studies have focused on evaluating the robustness of various query functions in AL, little to no attention has been given to the design of the initial labeled pool. Given the recent successes of learning representations in self-supervised/unsupervised ways, we propose to study if an intelligently sampled initial labeled pool can improve deep AL performance. We will investigate the effect of intelligently sampled initial labeled pools, including the use of self-supervised and unsupervised strategies, on deep AL methods. We describe our experimental details, implementation details, datasets, performance metrics as well as planned ablation studies in this proposal. If intelligently sampled initial pools improve AL performance, our work could make a positive contribution to boosting AL performance with no additional annotation, developing datasets with lesser annotation cost in general, and promoting further research in the use of unsupervised learning methods for AL.      
### 122.TransMIA: Membership Inference Attacks Using Transfer Shadow Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14661.pdf)
>  Transfer learning has been widely studied and gained increasing popularity to improve the accuracy of machine learning models by transferring some knowledge acquired in different training. However, no prior work has pointed out that transfer learning can strengthen privacy attacks on machine learning models. In this paper, we propose TransMIA (Transfer Learning-based Membership Inference Attacks), which use transfer learning to perform membership inference attacks on the source model when the adversary is able to access the parameters of the transferred model. In particular, we propose a transfer shadow training technique, where an adversary employs the parameters of the transferred model to construct shadow models, to significantly improve the performance of membership inference when a limited amount of shadow training data is available to the adversary. We evaluate our attacks using two real datasets, and show that our attacks outperform the state-of-the-art that does not use our transfer shadow training technique. We also compare four combinations of the learning-based/entropy-based approach and the fine-tuning/freezing approach, all of which employ our transfer shadow training technique. Then we examine the performance of these four approaches based on the distributions of confidence values, and discuss possible countermeasures against our attacks.      
### 123.SAR Image Despeckling Based on Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14627.pdf)
>  In Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, despeckling is very important for image analysis,whereas speckle is known as a kind of multiplicative noise caused by the coherent imaging system. During the past three decades, various algorithms have been proposed to denoise the SAR image. Generally, the BM3D is considered as the state of art technique to despeckle the speckle noise with excellent performance. More recently, deep learning make a success in image denoising and achieved a improvement over conventional method where large train dataset is required. Unlike most of the images SAR image despeckling approach, the proposed approach learns the speckle from corrupted images directly. In this paper, the limited scale of dataset make a efficient exploration by using convolutioal denoising autoencoder (C-DAE) to reconstruct the speckle-free SAR images. Batch normalization strategy is integrated with C- DAE to speed up the train time. Moreover, we compute image quality in standard metrics, PSNR and SSIM. It is revealed that our approach perform well than some others.      
### 124.Incremental Learning via Rate Reduction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14593.pdf)
>  Current deep learning architectures suffer from catastrophic forgetting, a failure to retain knowledge of previously learned classes when incrementally trained on new classes. The fundamental roadblock faced by deep learning methods is that deep learning models are optimized as "black boxes," making it difficult to properly adjust the model parameters to preserve knowledge about previously seen data. To overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, we propose utilizing an alternative "white box" architecture derived from the principle of rate reduction, where each layer of the network is explicitly computed without back propagation. Under this paradigm, we demonstrate that, given a pre-trained network and new data classes, our approach can provably construct a new network that emulates joint training with all past and new classes. Finally, our experiments show that our proposed learning algorithm observes significantly less decay in classification performance, outperforming state of the art methods on MNIST and CIFAR-10 by a large margin and justifying the use of "white box" algorithms for incremental learning even for sufficiently complex image data.      
### 125.Where Should We Begin? A Low-Level Exploration of Weight Initialization Impact on Quantized Behaviour of Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14578.pdf)
>  With the proliferation of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms for mobile processing, limited precision quantization has become an essential tool for CNN efficiency. Consequently, various works have sought to design fixed precision quantization algorithms and quantization-focused optimization techniques that minimize quantization induced performance degradation. However, there is little concrete understanding of how various CNN design decisions/best practices affect quantized inference behaviour. Weight initialization strategies are often associated with solving issues such as vanishing/exploding gradients but an often-overlooked aspect is their impact on the final trained distributions of each layer. We present an in-depth, fine-grained ablation study of the effect of different weights initializations on the final distributions of weights and activations of different CNN architectures. The fine-grained, layerwise analysis enables us to gain deep insights on how initial weights distributions will affect final accuracy and quantized behaviour. To our best knowledge, we are the first to perform such a low-level, in-depth quantitative analysis of weights initialization and its effect on quantized behaviour.      
### 126.Adaptive noise imitation for image denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14512.pdf)
>  The effectiveness of existing denoising algorithms typically relies on accurate pre-defined noise statistics or plenty of paired data, which limits their practicality. In this work, we focus on denoising in the more common case where noise statistics and paired data are unavailable. Considering that denoising CNNs require supervision, we develop a new \textbf{adaptive noise imitation (ADANI)} algorithm that can synthesize noisy data from naturally noisy images. To produce realistic noise, a noise generator takes unpaired noisy/clean images as input, where the noisy image is a guide for noise generation. By imposing explicit constraints on the type, level and gradient of noise, the output noise of ADANI will be similar to the guided noise, while keeping the original clean background of the image. Coupling the noisy data output from ADANI with the corresponding ground-truth, a denoising CNN is then trained in a fully-supervised manner. Experiments show that the noisy data produced by ADANI are visually and statistically similar to real ones so that the denoising CNN in our method is competitive to other networks trained with external paired data.      
### 127.Architectural Adversarial Robustness: The Case for Deep Pursuit  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14427.pdf)
>  Despite their unmatched performance, deep neural networks remain susceptible to targeted attacks by nearly imperceptible levels of adversarial noise. While the underlying cause of this sensitivity is not well understood, theoretical analyses can be simplified by reframing each layer of a feed-forward network as an approximate solution to a sparse coding problem. Iterative solutions using basis pursuit are theoretically more stable and have improved adversarial robustness. However, cascading layer-wise pursuit implementations suffer from error accumulation in deeper networks. In contrast, our new method of deep pursuit approximates the activations of all layers as a single global optimization problem, allowing us to consider deeper, real-world architectures with skip connections such as residual networks. Experimentally, our approach demonstrates improved robustness to adversarial noise.      
### 128.There and Back Again: Learning to Simulate Radar Data for Real-World Applications  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14389.pdf)
>  Simulating realistic radar data has the potential to significantly accelerate the development of data-driven approaches to radar processing. However, it is fraught with difficulty due to the notoriously complex image formation process. Here we propose to learn a radar sensor model capable of synthesising faithful radar observations based on simulated elevation maps. In particular, we adopt an adversarial approach to learning a forward sensor model from unaligned radar examples. In addition, modelling the backward model encourages the output to remain aligned to the world state through a cyclical consistency criterion. The backward model is further constrained to predict elevation maps from real radar data that are grounded by partial measurements obtained from corresponding lidar scans. Both models are trained in a joint optimisation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by evaluating a down-stream segmentation model trained purely on simulated data in a real-world deployment. This achieves performance within four percentage points of the same model trained entirely on real data.      
### 129.Overcoming Measurement Inconsistency in Deep Learning for Linear Inverse Problems: Applications in Medical Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14387.pdf)
>  The remarkable performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) currently makes them the method of choice for solving linear inverse problems. They have been applied to super-resolve and restore images, as well as to reconstruct MR and CT images. In these applications, DNNs invert a forward operator by finding, via training data, a map between the measurements and the input images. It is then expected that the map is still valid for the test data. This framework, however, introduces measurement inconsistency during testing. We show that such inconsistency, which can be critical in domains like medical imaging or defense, is intimately related to the generalization error. We then propose a framework that post-processes the output of DNNs with an optimization algorithm that enforces measurement consistency. Experiments on MR images show that enforcing measurement consistency via our method can lead to large gains in reconstruction performance.      
### 130.Single Image Super-resolution with a Switch Guided Hybrid Network for Satellite Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14380.pdf)
>  The major drawbacks with Satellite Images are low resolution, Low resolution makes it difficult to identify the objects present in Satellite images. We have experimented with several deep models available for Single Image Superresolution on the SpaceNet dataset and have evaluated the performance of each of them on the satellite image data. We will dive into the recent evolution of the deep models in the context of SISR over the past few years and will present a comparative study between these models. The entire Satellite image of an area is divided into equal-sized patches. Each patch will be used independently for training. These patches will differ in nature. Say, for example, the patches over urban areas have non-homogeneous backgrounds because of different types of objects like vehicles, buildings, roads, etc. On the other hand, patches over jungles will be more homogeneous in nature. Hence, different deep models will fit on different kinds of patches. In this study, we will try to explore this further with the help of a Switching Convolution Network. The idea is to train a switch classifier that will automatically classify a patch into one category of models best suited for it.      
### 131.A smartphone based multi input workflow for non-invasive estimation of haemoglobin levels using machine learning techniques  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14370.pdf)
>  We suggest a low cost, non invasive healthcare system that measures haemoglobin levels in patients and can be used as a preliminary diagnostic test for anaemia. A combination of image processing, machine learning and deep learning techniques are employed to develop predictive models to measure haemoglobin levels. This is achieved through the color analysis of the fingernail beds, palpebral conjunctiva and tongue of the patients. This predictive model is then encapsulated in a healthcare application. This application expedites data collection and facilitates active learning of the model. It also incorporates personalized calibration of the model for each patient, assisting in the continual monitoring of the haemoglobin levels of the patient. Upon validating this framework using data, it can serve as a highly accurate preliminary diagnostic test for anaemia.      
### 132.Semi-Supervised Learning of Mutually Accelerated Multi-Contrast MRI Synthesis without Fully-Sampled Ground-Truths  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14347.pdf)
>  This study proposes a novel semi-supervised learning framework for mutually accelerated multi-contrast MRI synthesis that recovers high-quality images without demanding large training sets of costly fully-sampled source or ground-truth target images. The proposed method presents a selective loss function expressed only on a subset of the acquired k-space coefficients and further leverages randomized sampling patterns across training subjects to effectively learn relationships among acquired and nonacquired k-space coefficients at all locations. Comprehensive experiments performed on multi-contrast brain images clearly demonstrate that the proposed method maintains equivalent performance to the gold-standard method based on fully-supervised training while alleviating undesirable reliance of the current synthesis methods on large-scale fully-sampled MRI acquisitions.      
### 133.Audio-visual Speech Separation with Adversarially Disentangled Visual Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14334.pdf)
>  Speech separation aims to separate individual voice from an audio mixture of multiple simultaneous talkers. Although audio-only approaches achieve satisfactory performance, they build on a strategy to handle the predefined conditions, limiting their application in the complex auditory scene. Towards the cocktail party problem, we propose a novel audio-visual speech separation model. In our model, we use the face detector to detect the number of speakers in the scene and use visual information to avoid the permutation problem. To improve our model's generalization ability to unknown speakers, we extract speech-related visual features from visual inputs explicitly by the adversarially disentangled method, and use this feature to assist speech separation. Besides, the time-domain approach is adopted, which could avoid the phase reconstruction problem existing in the time-frequency domain models. To compare our model's performance with other models, we create two benchmark datasets of 2-speaker mixture from GRID and TCDTIMIT audio-visual datasets. Through a series of experiments, our proposed model is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art audio-only model and three audio-visual models.      
### 134.Malaria Detection and Classificaiton  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14329.pdf)
>  Malaria is a disease of global concern according to the World Health Organization. Billions of people in the world are at risk of Malaria today. Microscopy is considered the gold standard for Malaria diagnosis. Microscopic assessment of blood samples requires the need of trained professionals who at times are not available in rural areas where Malaria is a problem. Full automation of Malaria diagnosis is a challenging task. In this work, we put forward a framework for diagnosis of malaria. We adopt a two layer approach, where we detect infected cells using a Faster-RCNN in the first layer, crop them out, and feed the cropped cells to a seperate neural network for classification. The proposed methodology was tested on an openly available dataset, this will serve as a baseline for the future methods as currently there is no common dataset on which results are reported for Malaria Diagnosis.

>  Internet memes have become an increasingly pervasive form of contemporary social communication that attracted a lot of research interest recently. In this paper, we analyze the data of 129,326 memes collected from Reddit in the middle of March, 2020, when the most serious coronavirus restrictions were being introduced around the world. This article not only provides a looking glass into the thoughts of Internet users during the COVID-19 pandemic but we also perform a content-based predictive analysis of what makes a meme go viral. Using machine learning methods, we also study what incremental predictive power image related attributes have over textual attributes on meme popularity. We find that the success of a meme can be predicted based on its content alone moderately well, our best performing machine learning model predicts viral memes with AUC=0.68. We also find that both image related and textual attributes have significant incremental predictive power over each other.      
### 136.Automated Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Based on Gleason Grading Using Convolutional Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14301.pdf)
>  The Gleason grading system using histological images is the most powerful diagnostic and prognostic predictor of prostate cancer. The current standard inspection is evaluating Gleason H&amp;E-stained histopathology images by pathologists. However, it is complicated, time-consuming, and subject to observers. Deep learning (DL) based-methods that automatically learn image features and achieve higher generalization ability have attracted significant attention. However, challenges remain especially using DL to train the whole slide image (WSI), a predominant clinical source in the current diagnostic setting, containing billions of pixels, morphological heterogeneity, and artifacts. Hence, we proposed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based automatic classification method for accurate grading of PCa using whole slide histopathology images. In this paper, a data augmentation method named Patch-Based Image Reconstruction (PBIR) was proposed to reduce the high resolution and increase the diversity of WSIs. In addition, a distribution correction (DC) module was developed to enhance the adaption of pretrained model to the target dataset by adjusting the data distribution. Besides, a Quadratic Weighted Mean Square Error (QWMSE) function was presented to reduce the misdiagnosis caused by equal Euclidean distances. Our experiments indicated the combination of PBIR, DC, and QWMSE function was necessary for achieving superior expert-level performance, leading to the best results (0.8885 quadratic-weighted kappa coefficient).      
### 137.Fully Quantized Image Super-Resolution Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14265.pdf)
>  With the rising popularity of intelligent mobile devices, it is of great practical significance to develop accurate, realtime and energy-efficient image Super-Resolution (SR) inference methods. A prevailing method for improving the inference efficiency is model quantization, which allows for replacing the expensive floating-point operations with efficient fixed-point or bitwise arithmetic. To date, it is still challenging for quantized SR frameworks to deliver feasible accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Here, we propose a Fully Quantized image Super-Resolution framework (FQSR) to jointly optimize efficiency and accuracy. In particular, we target on obtaining end-to-end quantized models for all layers, especially including skip connections, which was rarely addressed in the literature. We further identify training obstacles faced by low-bit SR networks and propose two novel methods accordingly. The two difficulites are caused by 1) activation and weight distributions being vastly distinctive in different layers; 2) the inaccurate approximation of the quantization. We apply our quantization scheme on multiple mainstream super-resolution architectures, including SRResNet, SRGAN and EDSR. Experimental results show that our FQSR using low bits quantization can achieve on par performance compared with the full-precision counterparts on five benchmark datasets and surpass state-of-the-art quantized SR methods with significantly reduced computational cost and memory consumption.      
### 138.Artificial Intelligence applied to chest X-Ray images for the automatic detection of COVID-19. A thoughtful evaluation approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14259.pdf)
>  Current standard protocols used in the clinic for diagnosing COVID-19 include molecular or antigen tests, generally complemented by a plain chest X-Ray. The combined analysis aims to reduce the significant number of false negatives of these tests, but also to provide complementary evidence about the presence and severity of the disease. However, the procedure is not free of errors, and the interpretation of the chest X-Ray is only restricted to radiologists due to its complexity. With the long term goal to provide new evidence for the diagnosis, this paper presents an evaluation of different methods based on a deep neural network. These are the first steps to develop an automatic COVID-19 diagnosis tool using chest X-Ray images, that would additionally differentiate between controls, pneumonia or COVID-19 groups. The paper describes the process followed to train a Convolutional Neural Network with a dataset of more than 79,500 X-Ray images compiled from different sources, including more than 8,500 COVID-19 examples. For the sake of evaluation and comparison of the models developed, three different experiments were carried out following three preprocessing schemes. The aim is to evaluate how preprocessing the data affects the results and improves its explainability. Likewise, a critical analysis is carried out about different variability issues that might compromise the system and the effects on the performance. With the employed methodology, a 91.5% classification accuracy is obtained, with a 87.4% average recall for the worst but most explainable experiment, which requires a previous automatic segmentation of the lungs region.      
### 139.Deep Learning for Regularization Prediction in Diffeomorphic Image Registration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14229.pdf)
>  This paper presents a predictive model for estimating regularization parameters of diffeomorphic image registration. We introduce a novel framework that automatically determines the parameters controlling the smoothness of diffeomorphic transformations. Our method significantly reduces the effort of parameter tuning, which is time and labor-consuming. To achieve the goal, we develop a predictive model based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) that learns the mapping between pairwise images and the regularization parameter of image registration. In contrast to previous methods that estimate such parameters in a high-dimensional image space, our model is built in an efficient bandlimited space with much lower dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both 2D synthetic data and 3D real brain images. Experimental results show that our model not only predicts appropriate regularization parameters for image registration, but also improving the network training in terms of time and memory efficiency.      
### 140.Curvature Regularization to Prevent Distortion in Graph Embedding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14211.pdf)
>  Recent research on graph embedding has achieved success in various applications. Most graph embedding methods preserve the proximity in a graph into a manifold in an embedding space. We argue an important but neglected problem about this proximity-preserving strategy: Graph topology patterns, while preserved well into an embedding manifold by preserving proximity, may distort in the ambient embedding Euclidean space, and hence to detect them becomes difficult for machine learning models. To address the problem, we propose curvature regularization, to enforce flatness for embedding manifolds, thereby preventing the distortion. We present a novel angle-based sectional curvature, termed ABS curvature, and accordingly three kinds of curvature regularization to induce flat embedding manifolds during graph embedding. We integrate curvature regularization into five popular proximity-preserving embedding methods, and empirical results in two applications show significant improvements on a wide range of open graph datasets.      
### 141.Lattice Fusion Networks for Image Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14196.pdf)
>  A novel method for feature fusion in convolutional neural networks is proposed in this work. Different feature fusion techniques are suggested to facilitate the flow of information and improve the training of deep neural networks. Some of these techniques as well as the proposed model can be considered a type of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Network, where a layer can receive inputs from other layers and have outputs to other layers. In the proposed general framework of Lattice Fusion Network (LFN), feature maps of each convolutional layer are passed to other layers based on a lattice graph structure, where nodes are convolutional layers. To investigate the performance of the model, a specific design based on the general framework of LFN is implemented for image denoising. Results are compared with state of the art methods. The proposed model produced competitive results with far fewer learnable parameters, which shows the effectiveness of LFNs for training of deep neural networks      
### 142.Inter-slice Context Residual Learning for 3D Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14155.pdf)
>  Automated and accurate 3D medical image segmentation plays an essential role in assisting medical professionals to evaluate disease progresses and make fast therapeutic schedules. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have widely applied to this task, the accuracy of these models still need to be further improved mainly due to their limited ability to 3D context perception. In this paper, we propose the 3D context residual network (ConResNet) for the accurate segmentation of 3D medical images. This model consists of an encoder, a segmentation decoder, and a context residual decoder. We design the context residual module and use it to bridge both decoders at each scale. Each context residual module contains both context residual mapping and context attention mapping, the formal aims to explicitly learn the inter-slice context information and the latter uses such context as a kind of attention to boost the segmentation accuracy. We evaluated this model on the MICCAI 2018 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset and NIH Pancreas Segmentation (Pancreas-CT) dataset. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 3D context residual learning scheme but also indicate that the proposed ConResNet is more accurate than six top-ranking methods in brain tumor segmentation and seven top-ranking methods in pancreas segmentation.

### 143.Retrospective Motion Correction of MR Images using Prior-Assisted Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14134.pdf)
>  In MRI, motion artefacts are among the most common types of artefacts. They can degrade images and render them unusable for accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods, such as prospective or retrospective motion correction, have been proposed to avoid or alleviate motion artefacts. Recently, several other methods based on deep learning approaches have been proposed to solve this problem. This work proposes to enhance the performance of existing deep learning models by the inclusion of additional information present as image priors. The proposed approach has shown promising results and will be further investigated for clinical validity.      
### 144.MIINet: An Image Quality Improvement Framework for Supporting Medical Diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14132.pdf)
>  Medical images have been indispensable and useful tools for supporting medical experts in making diagnostic decisions. However, taken medical images especially throat and endoscopy images are normally hazy, lack of focus, or uneven illumination. Thus, these could difficult the diagnosis process for doctors. In this paper, we propose MIINet, a novel image-to-image translation network for improving quality of medical images by unsupervised translating low-quality images to the high-quality clean version. Our MIINet is not only capable of generating high-resolution clean images, but also preserving the attributes of original images, making the diagnostic more favorable for doctors. Experiments on dehazing 100 practical throat images show that our MIINet largely improves the mean doctor opinion score (MDOS), which assesses the quality and the reproducibility of the images from the baseline of 2.36 to 4.11, while dehazed images by CycleGAN got lower score of 3.83. The MIINet is confirmed by three physicians to be satisfying in supporting throat disease diagnostic from original low-quality images.      
### 145.Robotic grasp detection using a novel two-stage approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14123.pdf)
>  Recently, deep learning has been successfully applied to robotic grasp detection. Based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), there have been lots of end-to-end detection approaches. But end-to-end approaches have strict requirements for the dataset used for training the neural network models and it's hard to achieve in practical use. Therefore, we proposed a two-stage approach using particle swarm optimizer (PSO) candidate estimator and CNN to detect the most likely grasp. Our approach achieved an accuracy of 92.8% on the Cornell Grasp Dataset, which leaped into the front ranks of the existing approaches and is able to run at real-time speeds. After a small change of the approach, we can predict multiple grasps per object in the meantime so that an object can be grasped in a variety of ways.      
### 146.Time-series Change Point Detection with Self-Supervised Contrastive Predictive Coding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14097.pdf)
>  Change Point Detection techniques aim to capture changes in trends and sequences in time-series data to describe the underlying behaviour of the system. Detecting changes and anomalies in the web services, the trend of applications usage can provide valuable insight towards the system, however, many existing approaches are done in a supervised manner, requiring well-labelled data. As the amount of data produced and captured by sensors are growing rapidly, it is getting harder and even impossible to annotate the data. Therefore, coming up with a self-supervised solution is a necessity these days. In this work, we propose TSCP a novel self-supervised technique for temporal change point detection, based on representation learning with Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method is the first method which employs Contrastive Learning for prediction with the aim change point detection. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our method outperforms multiple state-of-the-art change point detection and anomaly detection baselines, including those adopting either unsupervised or semi-supervised approach. TSCP is shown to improve both non-Deep learning- and Deep learning-based methods by 0.28 and 0.12 in terms of average F1-score across three datasets.      
### 147.FreezeNet: Full Performance by Reduced Storage Costs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14087.pdf)
>  Pruning generates sparse networks by setting parameters to zero. In this work we improve one-shot pruning methods, applied before training, without adding any additional storage costs while preserving the sparse gradient computations. The main difference to pruning is that we do not sparsify the network's weights but learn just a few key parameters and keep the other ones fixed at their random initialized value. This mechanism is called freezing the parameters. Those frozen weights can be stored efficiently with a single 32bit random seed number. The parameters to be frozen are determined one-shot by a single for- and backward pass applied before training starts. We call the introduced method FreezeNet. In our experiments we show that FreezeNets achieve good results, especially for extreme freezing rates. Freezing weights preserves the gradient flow throughout the network and consequently, FreezeNets train better and have an increased capacity compared to their pruned counterparts. On the classification tasks MNIST and CIFAR-10/100 we outperform SNIP, in this setting the best reported one-shot pruning method, applied before training. On MNIST, FreezeNet achieves 99.2% performance of the baseline LeNet-5-Caffe architecture, while compressing the number of trained and stored parameters by a factor of x 157.      
### 148.OpenKBP: The open-access knowledge-based planning grand challenge  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14076.pdf)
>  The purpose of this work is to advance fair and consistent comparisons of dose prediction methods for knowledge-based planning (KBP) in radiation therapy research. We hosted OpenKBP, a 2020 AAPM Grand Challenge, and challenged participants to develop the best method for predicting the dose of contoured CT images. The models were evaluated according to two separate scores: (1) dose score, which evaluates the full 3D dose distributions, and (2) dose-volume histogram (DVH) score, which evaluates a set DVH metrics. Participants were given the data of 340 patients who were treated for head-and-neck cancer with radiation therapy. The data was partitioned into training (n=200), validation (n=40), and testing (n=100) datasets. All participants performed training and validation with the corresponding datasets during the validation phase of the Challenge, and we ranked the models in the testing phase based on out-of-sample performance. The Challenge attracted 195 participants from 28 countries, and 73 of those participants formed 44 teams in the validation phase, which received a total of 1750 submissions. The testing phase garnered submissions from 28 teams. On average, over the course of the validation phase, participants improved the dose and DVH scores of their models by a factor of 2.7 and 5.7, respectively. In the testing phase one model achieved significantly better dose and DVH score than the runner-up models. Lastly, many of the top performing teams reported using generalizable techniques (e.g., ensembles) to achieve higher performance than their competition. This is the first competition for knowledge-based planning research, and it helped launch the first platform for comparing KBP prediction methods fairly and consistently. The OpenKBP datasets are available publicly to help benchmark future KBP research, which has also democratized KBP research by making it accessible to everyone.      
### 149.Differences between human and machine perception in medical diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14036.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) show promise in image-based medical diagnosis, but cannot be fully trusted since their performance can be severely degraded by dataset shifts to which human perception remains invariant. If we can better understand the differences between human and machine perception, we can potentially characterize and mitigate this effect. We therefore propose a framework for comparing human and machine perception in medical diagnosis. The two are compared with respect to their sensitivity to the removal of clinically meaningful information, and to the regions of an image deemed most suspicious. Drawing inspiration from the natural image domain, we frame both comparisons in terms of perturbation robustness. The novelty of our framework is that separate analyses are performed for subgroups with clinically meaningful differences. We argue that this is necessary in order to avert Simpson's paradox and draw correct conclusions. We demonstrate our framework with a case study in breast cancer screening, and reveal significant differences between radiologists and DNNs. We compare the two with respect to their robustness to Gaussian low-pass filtering, performing a subgroup analysis on microcalcifications and soft tissue lesions. For microcalcifications, DNNs use a separate set of high frequency components than radiologists, some of which lie outside the image regions considered most suspicious by radiologists. These features run the risk of being spurious, but if not, could represent potential new biomarkers. For soft tissue lesions, the divergence between radiologists and DNNs is even starker, with DNNs relying heavily on spurious high frequency components ignored by radiologists. Importantly, this deviation in soft tissue lesions was only observable through subgroup analysis, which highlights the importance of incorporating medical domain knowledge into our comparison framework.      
### 150.Voting based ensemble improves robustness of defensive models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14031.pdf)
>  Developing robust models against adversarial perturbations has been an active area of research and many algorithms have been proposed to train individual robust models. Taking these pretrained robust models, we aim to study whether it is possible to create an ensemble to further improve robustness. Several previous attempts tackled this problem by ensembling the soft-label prediction and have been proved vulnerable based on the latest attack methods. In this paper, we show that if the robust training loss is diverse enough, a simple hard-label based voting ensemble can boost the robust error over each individual model. Furthermore, given a pool of robust models, we develop a principled way to select which models to ensemble. Finally, to verify the improved robustness, we conduct extensive experiments to study how to attack a voting-based ensemble and develop several new white-box attacks. On CIFAR-10 dataset, by ensembling several state-of-the-art pre-trained defense models, our method can achieve a 59.8% robust accuracy, outperforming all the existing defensive models without using additional data.      
### 151.Active Learning in CNNs via Expected Improvement Maximization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14015.pdf)
>  Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated high levels of effectiveness in a variety of domains, including computer vision and more recently, computational biology. However, training effective models often requires assembling and/or labeling large datasets, which may be prohibitively time-consuming or costly. Pool-based active learning techniques have the potential to mitigate these issues, leveraging models trained on limited data to selectively query unlabeled data points from a pool in an attempt to expedite the learning process. Here we present "Dropout-based Expected IMprOvementS" (DEIMOS), a flexible and computationally-efficient approach to active learning that queries points that are expected to maximize the model's improvement across a representative sample of points. The proposed framework enables us to maintain a prediction covariance matrix capturing model uncertainty, and to dynamically update this matrix in order to generate diverse batches of points in the batch-mode setting. Our active learning results demonstrate that DEIMOS outperforms several existing baselines across multiple regression and classification tasks taken from computer vision and genomics.      
### 152.Three-dimensional Segmentation of the Scoliotic Spine from MRI using Unsupervised Volume-based MR-CT Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14005.pdf)
>  Vertebral bone segmentation from magnetic resonance (MR) images is a challenging task. Due to the inherent nature of the modality to emphasize soft tissues of the body, common thresholding algorithms are ineffective in detecting bones in MR images. On the other hand, it is relatively easier to segment bones from CT images because of the high contrast between bones and the surrounding regions. For this reason, we perform a cross-modality synthesis between MR and CT domains for simple thresholding-based segmentation of the vertebral bones. However, this implicitly assumes the availability of paired MR-CT data, which is rare, especially in the case of scoliotic patients. In this paper, we present a completely unsupervised, fully three-dimensional (3D) cross-modality synthesis method for segmenting scoliotic spines. A 3D CycleGAN model is trained for an unpaired volume-to-volume translation across MR and CT domains. Then, the Otsu thresholding algorithm is applied to the synthesized CT volumes for easy segmentation of the vertebral bones. The resulting segmentation is used to reconstruct a 3D model of the spine. We validate our method on 28 scoliotic vertebrae in 3 patients by computing the point-to-surface mean distance between the landmark points for each vertebra obtained from pre-operative X-rays and the surface of the segmented vertebra. Our study results in a mean error of 3.41 $\pm$ 1.06 mm. Based on qualitative and quantitative results, we conclude that our method is able to obtain a good segmentation and 3D reconstruction of scoliotic spines, all after training from unpaired data in an unsupervised manner.      
### 153.Trends in deep learning for medical hyperspectral image analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13974.pdf)
>  Deep learning algorithms have seen acute growth of interest in their applications throughout several fields of interest in the last decade, with medical hyperspectral imaging being a particularly promising domain. So far, to the best of our knowledge, there is no review paper that discusses the implementation of deep learning for medical hyperspectral imaging, which is what this review paper aims to accomplish by examining publications that currently utilize deep learning to perform effective analysis of medical hyperspectral imagery. This paper discusses deep learning concepts that are relevant and applicable to medical hyperspectral imaging analysis, several of which have been implemented since the boom in deep learning. This will comprise of reviewing the use of deep learning for classification, segmentation, and detection in order to investigate the analysis of medical hyperspectral imaging. Lastly, we discuss the current and future challenges pertaining to this discipline and the possible efforts to overcome such trials.      
### 154.Modelling brain lesion volume in patches with CNN-based Poisson Regression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13927.pdf)
>  Monitoring the progression of lesions is important for clinical response. Summary statistics such as lesion volume are objective and easy to interpret, which can help clinicians assess lesion growth or decay. CNNs are commonly used in medical image segmentation for their ability to produce useful features within large contexts and their associated efficient iterative patch-based training. Many CNN architectures require hundreds of thousands parameters to yield a good segmentation. In this work, an efficient, computationally inexpensive CNN is implemented to estimate the number of lesion voxels in a predefined patch size from magnetic resonance (MR) images. The output of the CNN is interpreted as the conditional Poisson parameter over the patch, allowing standard mini-batch gradient descent to be employed. The ISLES2015 (SISS) data is used to train and evaluate the model, which by estimating lesion volume from raw features, accurately identified the lesion image with the larger lesion volume for 86% of paired sample patches. An argument for the development and use of estimating lesion volumes to also aid in model selection for segmentation is made.
