### 1.Semantic Image Synthesis via Efficient Class-Adaptive Normalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04644.pdf)
>  Spatially-adaptive normalization (SPADE) is remarkably successful recently in conditional semantic image synthesis, which modulates the normalized activation with spatially-varying transformations learned from semantic layouts, to prevent the semantic information from being washed away. Despite its impressive performance, a more thorough understanding of the advantages inside the box is still highly demanded to help reduce the significant computation and parameter overhead introduced by this novel structure. In this paper, from a return-on-investment point of view, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of this spatially-adaptive normalization and observe that its modulation parameters benefit more from semantic-awareness rather than spatial-adaptiveness, especially for high-resolution input masks. Inspired by this observation, we propose class-adaptive normalization (CLADE), a lightweight but equally-effective variant that is only adaptive to semantic class. In order to further improve spatial-adaptiveness, we introduce intra-class positional map encoding calculated from semantic layouts to modulate the normalization parameters of CLADE and propose a truly spatially-adaptive variant of CLADE, namely CLADE-ICPE. %Benefiting from this design, CLADE greatly reduces the computation cost while being able to preserve the semantic information in the generation. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed CLADE can be generalized to different SPADE-based methods while achieving comparable generation quality compared to SPADE, but it is much more efficient with fewer extra parameters and lower computational cost.

### 2.The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis for Object Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04643.pdf)
>  Recognition tasks, such as object recognition and keypoint estimation, have seen widespread adoption in recent years. Most state-of-the-art methods for these tasks use deep networks that are computationally expensive and have huge memory footprints. This makes it exceedingly difficult to deploy these systems on low power embedded devices. Hence, the importance of decreasing the storage requirements and the amount of computation in such models is paramount. The recently proposed Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) states that deep neural networks trained on large datasets contain smaller subnetworks that achieve on par performance as the dense networks. In this work, we perform the first empirical study investigating LTH for model pruning in the context of object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint estimation. Our studies reveal that lottery tickets obtained from ImageNet pretraining do not transfer well to the downstream tasks. We provide guidance on how to find lottery tickets with up to 80% overall sparsity on different sub-tasks without incurring any drop in the performance. Finally, we analyse the behavior of trained tickets with respect to various task attributes such as object size, frequency, and difficulty of detection.      
### 3.Vid2CAD: CAD Model Alignment using Multi-View Constraints from Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04641.pdf)
>  We address the task of aligning CAD models to a video sequence of a complex scene containing multiple objects. Our method is able to process arbitrary videos and fully automatically recover the 9 DoF pose for each object appearing in it, thus aligning them in a common 3D coordinate frame. The core idea of our method is to integrate neural network predictions from individual frames with a temporally global, multi-view constraint optimization formulation. This integration process resolves the scale and depth ambiguities in the per-frame predictions, and generally improves the estimate of all pose parameters. By leveraging multi-view constraints, our method also resolves occlusions and handles objects that are out of view in individual frames, thus reconstructing all objects into a single globally consistent CAD representation of the scene. In comparison to the state-of-the-art single-frame method Mask2CAD that we build on, we achieve substantial improvements on Scan2CAD (from 11.6% to 30.2% class average accuracy).      
### 4.TAP: Text-Aware Pre-training for Text-VQA and Text-Caption  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04638.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose Text-Aware Pre-training (TAP) for Text-VQA and Text-Caption tasks. These two tasks aim at reading and understanding scene text in images for question answering and image caption generation, respectively. In contrast to the conventional vision-language pre-training that fails to capture scene text and its relationship with the visual and text modalities, TAP explicitly incorporates scene text (generated from OCR engines) in pre-training. With three pre-training tasks, including masked language modeling (MLM), image-text (contrastive) matching (ITM), and relative (spatial) position prediction (RPP), TAP effectively helps the model learn a better aligned representation among the three modalities: text word, visual object, and scene text. Due to this aligned representation learning, even pre-trained on the same downstream task dataset, TAP already boosts the absolute accuracy on the TextVQA dataset by +5.4%, compared with a non-TAP baseline. To further improve the performance, we build a large-scale dataset based on the Conceptual Caption dataset, named OCR-CC, which contains 1.4 million scene text-related image-text pairs. Pre-trained on this OCR-CC dataset, our approach outperforms the state of the art by large margins on multiple tasks, i.e., +8.3% accuracy on TextVQA, +8.6% accuracy on ST-VQA, and +10.2 CIDEr score on TextCaps.      
### 5.Accurate 3D Object Detection using Energy-Based Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04634.pdf)
>  Accurate 3D object detection (3DOD) is crucial for safe navigation of complex environments by autonomous robots. Regressing accurate 3D bounding boxes in cluttered environments based on sparse LiDAR data is however a highly challenging problem. We address this task by exploring recent advances in conditional energy-based models (EBMs) for probabilistic regression. While methods employing EBMs for regression have demonstrated impressive performance on 2D object detection in images, these techniques are not directly applicable to 3D bounding boxes. In this work, we therefore design a differentiable pooling operator for 3D bounding boxes, serving as the core module of our EBM network. We further integrate this general approach into the state-of-the-art 3D object detector SA-SSD. On the KITTI dataset, our proposed approach consistently outperforms the SA-SSD baseline across all 3DOD metrics, demonstrating the potential of EBM-based regression for highly accurate 3DOD.

### 6.CASTing Your Model: Learning to Localize Improves Self-Supervised Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04630.pdf)
>  Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have largely closed the gap with supervised ImageNet pretraining. Despite their success these methods have been primarily applied to unlabeled ImageNet images, and show marginal gains when trained on larger sets of uncurated images. We hypothesize that current SSL methods perform best on iconic images, and struggle on complex scene images with many objects. Analyzing contrastive SSL methods shows that they have poor visual grounding and receive poor supervisory signal when trained on scene images. We propose Contrastive Attention-Supervised Tuning(CAST) to overcome these limitations. CAST uses unsupervised saliency maps to intelligently sample crops, and to provide grounding supervision via a Grad-CAM attention loss. Experiments on COCO show that CAST significantly improves the features learned by SSL methods on scene images, and further experiments show that CAST-trained models are more robust to changes in backgrounds.      
### 7.MERANet: Facial Micro-Expression Recognition using 3D Residual Attention Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04581.pdf)
>  We propose a facial micro-expression recognition model using 3D residual attention network called MERANet. The proposed model takes advantage of spatial-temporal attention and channel attention together, to learn deeper fine-grained subtle features for classification of emotions. The proposed model also encompasses both spatial and temporal information simultaneously using the 3D kernels and residual connections. Moreover, the channel features and spatio-temporal features are re-calibrated using the channel and spatio-temporal attentions, respectively in each residual module. The experiments are conducted on benchmark facial micro-expression datasets. A superior performance is observed as compared to the state-of-the-art for facial micro-expression recognition.      
### 8.Bayesian Image Reconstruction using Deep Generative Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04567.pdf)
>  Machine learning models are commonly trained end-to-end and in a supervised setting, using paired (input, output) data. Classical examples include recent super-resolution methods that train on pairs of (low-resolution, high-resolution) images. However, these end-to-end approaches require re-training every time there is a distribution shift in the inputs (e.g., night images vs daylight) or relevant latent variables (e.g., camera blur or hand motion). In this work, we leverage state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models (here StyleGAN2) for building powerful image priors, which enable application of Bayes' theorem for many downstream reconstruction tasks. Our method, called Bayesian Reconstruction through Generative Models (BRGM), uses a single pre-trained generator model to solve different image restoration tasks, i.e., super-resolution and in-painting, by combining it with different forward corruption models. We demonstrate BRGM on three large, yet diverse, datasets that enable us to build powerful priors: (i) 60,000 images from the Flick Faces High Quality dataset \cite{karras2019style} (ii) 240,000 chest X-rays from MIMIC III and (iii) a combined collection of 5 brain MRI datasets with 7,329 scans. Across all three datasets and without any dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning, our approach yields state-of-the-art performance on super-resolution, particularly at low-resolution levels, as well as inpainting, compared to state-of-the-art methods that are specific to each reconstruction task. We will make our code and pre-trained models available online.      
### 9.CoShaRP: A Convex Program for Single-shot Tomographic Shape Sensing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04551.pdf)
>  We introduce single-shot X-ray tomography that aims to estimate the target image from a single cone-beam projection measurement. This linear inverse problem is extremely under-determined since the measurements are far fewer than the number of unknowns. Moreover, it is more challenging than conventional tomography where a sufficiently large number of projection angles forms the measurements, allowing for a simple inversion process. However, single-shot tomography becomes less severe if the target image is only composed of known shapes. Hence, the shape prior transforms a linear ill-posed image estimation problem to a non-linear problem of estimating the roto-translations of the shapes. In this paper, we circumvent the non-linearity by using a dictionary of possible roto-translations of the shapes. We propose a convex program CoShaRP to recover the dictionary-coefficients successfully. CoShaRP relies on simplex-type constraint and can be solved quickly using a primal-dual algorithm. The numerical experiments show that CoShaRP recovers shapes stably from moderately noisy measurements.      
### 10.Cross-Modal Collaborative Representation Learning and a Large-Scale RGBT Benchmark for Crowd Counting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04529.pdf)
>  Crowd counting is a fundamental yet challenging problem, which desires rich information to generate pixel-wise crowd density maps. However, most previous methods only utilized the limited information of RGB images and may fail to discover the potential pedestrians in unconstrained environments. In this work, we find that incorporating optical and thermal information can greatly help to recognize pedestrians. To promote future researches in this field, we introduce a large-scale RGBT Crowd Counting (RGBT-CC) benchmark, which contains 2,030 pairs of RGB-thermal images with 138,389 annotated people. Furthermore, to facilitate the multimodal crowd counting, we propose a cross-modal collaborative representation learning framework, which consists of multiple modality-specific branches, a modality-shared branch, and an Information Aggregation-Distribution Module (IADM) to fully capture the complementary information of different modalities. Specifically, our IADM incorporates two collaborative information transfer components to dynamically enhance the modality-shared and modality-specific representations with a dual information propagation mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on the RGBT-CC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for RGBT crowd counting. Moreover, the proposed approach is universal for multimodal crowd counting and is also capable to achieve superior performance on the ShanghaiTechRGBD dataset.      
### 11.Digital Gimbal: End-to-end Deep Image Stabilization with Learnable Exposure Times  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04515.pdf)
>  Mechanical image stabilization using actuated gimbals enables capturing long-exposure shots without suffering from blur due to camera motion. These devices, however, are often physically cumbersome and expensive, limiting their widespread use. In this work, we propose to digitally emulate a mechanically stabilized system from the input of a fast unstabilized camera. To exploit the trade-off between motion blur at long exposures and low SNR at short exposures, we train a CNN that estimates a sharp high-SNR image by aggregating a burst of noisy short-exposure frames, related by unknown motion. We further suggest learning the burst's exposure times in an end-to-end manner, thus balancing the noise and blur across the frames. We demonstrate this method's advantage over the traditional approach of deblurring a single image or denoising a fixed-exposure burst.      
### 12.Human Motion Tracking by Registering an Articulated Surface to 3-D Points and Normals  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04514.pdf)
>  We address the problem of human motion tracking by registering a surface to 3-D data. We propose a method that iteratively computes two things: Maximum likelihood estimates for both the kinematic and free-motion parameters of a kinematic human-body representation, as well as probabilities that the data are assigned either to a body part, or to an outlier cluster. We introduce a new metric between observed points and normals on one side, and a parameterized surface on the other side, the latter being defined as a blending over a set of ellipsoids. We claim that this metric is well suited when one deals with either visual-hull or visual-shape observations. We illustrate the method by tracking human motions using sparse visual-shape data (3-D surface points and normals) gathered from imperfect silhouettes.      
### 13.SSCNav: Confidence-Aware Semantic Scene Completion for Visual Semantic Navigation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04512.pdf)
>  This paper focuses on visual semantic navigation, the task of producing actions for an active agent to navigate to a specified target object category in an unknown environment. To complete this task, the algorithm should simultaneously locate and navigate to an instance of the category. In comparison to the traditional point goal navigation, this task requires the agent to have a stronger contextual prior of indoor environments. We introduce SSCNav, an algorithm that explicitly models scene priors using a confidence-aware semantic scene completion module to complete the scene and guide the agent's navigation planning. Given a partial observation of the environment, SSCNav first infers a complete scene representation with semantic labels for the unobserved scene together with a confidence map associated with its own prediction. Then, a policy network infers the action from the scene completion result and confidence map. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed scene completion module improves the efficiency of the downstream navigation policies. <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://youtu.be/tfBbdGS72zg" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 14.Rotation-Invariant Autoencoders for Signals on Spheres  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04474.pdf)
>  Omnidirectional images and spherical representations of $3D$ shapes cannot be processed with conventional 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the unwrapping leads to large distortion. Using fast implementations of spherical and $SO(3)$ convolutions, researchers have recently developed deep learning methods better suited for classifying spherical images. These newly proposed convolutional layers naturally extend the notion of convolution to functions on the unit sphere $S^2$ and the group of rotations $SO(3)$ and these layers are equivariant to 3D rotations. In this paper, we consider the problem of unsupervised learning of rotation-invariant representations for spherical images. In particular, we carefully design an autoencoder architecture consisting of $S^2$ and $SO(3)$ convolutional layers. As 3D rotations are often a nuisance factor, the latent space is constrained to be exactly invariant to these input transformations. As the rotation information is discarded in the latent space, we craft a novel rotation-invariant loss function for training the network. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the usefulness of the learned representations on clustering, retrieval and classification applications.      
### 15.Multi-Objective Interpolation Training for Robustness to Label Noise  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04462.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks trained with standard cross-entropy loss memorize noisy labels, which degrades their performance. Most research to mitigate this memorization proposes new robust classification loss functions. Conversely, we explore the behavior of supervised contrastive learning under label noise to understand how it can improve image classification in these scenarios. In particular, we propose a Multi-Objective Interpolation Training (MOIT) approach that jointly exploits contrastive learning and classification. We show that standard contrastive learning degrades in the presence of label noise and propose an interpolation training strategy to mitigate this behavior. We further propose a novel label noise detection method that exploits the robust feature representations learned via contrastive learning to estimate per-sample soft-labels whose disagreements with the original labels accurately identify noisy samples. This detection allows treating noisy samples as unlabeled and training a classifier in a semi-supervised manner. We further propose MOIT+, a refinement of MOIT by fine-tuning on detected clean samples. Hyperparameter and ablation studies verify the key components of our method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world noise benchmarks demonstrate that MOIT/MOIT+ achieves state-of-the-art results.

### 16.SPU-Net: Self-Supervised Point Cloud Upsampling by Coarse-to-Fine Reconstruction with Self-Projection Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04439.pdf)
>  The task of point cloud upsampling aims to acquire dense and uniform point sets from sparse and irregular point sets. Although significant progress has been made with deep learning models, they require ground-truth dense point sets as the supervision information, which can only trained on synthetic paired training data and are not suitable for training under real-scanned sparse data. However, it is expensive and tedious to obtain large scale paired sparse-dense point sets for training from real scanned sparse data. To address this problem, we propose a self-supervised point cloud upsampling network, named SPU-Net, to capture the inherent upsampling patterns of points lying on the underlying object surface. Specifically, we propose a coarse-to-fine reconstruction framework, which contains two main components: point feature extraction and point feature expansion, respectively. In the point feature extraction, we integrate self-attention module with graph convolution network (GCN) to simultaneously capture context information inside and among local regions. In the point feature expansion, we introduce a hierarchically learnable folding strategy to generate the upsampled point sets with learnable 2D grids. Moreover, to further optimize the noisy points in the generated point sets, we propose a novel self-projection optimization associated with uniform and reconstruction terms, as a joint loss, to facilitate the self-supervised point cloud upsampling. We conduct various experiments on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets, and the results demonstrate that we achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art supervised methods.      
### 17.Structure-Consistent Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection with Local Saliency Coherence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04404.pdf)
>  Sparse labels have been attracting much attention in recent years. However, the performance gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised salient object detection methods is huge, and most previous weakly supervised works adopt complex training methods with many bells and whistles. In this work, we propose a one-round end-to-end training approach for weakly supervised salient object detection via scribble annotations without pre/post-processing operations or extra supervision data. Since scribble labels fail to offer detailed salient regions, we propose a local coherence loss to propagate the labels to unlabeled regions based on image features and pixel distance, so as to predict integral salient regions with complete object structures. We design a saliency structure consistency loss as self-supervision to ensure consistent saliency maps are predicted with different scales of the same image as input, which could be viewed as a regularization technique to enhance the model generalization ability. Additionally, we design an aggregation module (AGGM) to better integrate high-level features, low-level features and global context information for the decoder to aggregate various information. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks (e.g. for the ECSSD dataset: F_\beta = 0.8995, E_\xi = 0.9079 and MAE = 0.0489$), with an average gain of 4.60\% for F-measure, 2.05\% for E-measure and 1.88\% for MAE over the previous best method on this task.

### 18.Using Feature Alignment can Improve Clean Average Precision and Adversarial Robustness in Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04382.pdf)
>  The 2D object detection in clean images has been a well studied topic, but its vulnerability against adversarial attacks is still worrying. Existing work has improved the robustness of object detector by adversarial training, but at the same time, the average precision (AP) on clean images drops significantly. In this paper, we improve object detection algorithm by guiding the output of intermediate feature layer. On the basis of adversarial training, we propose two feature alignment methods, namely Knowledge-Distilled Feature Alignment (KDFA) and Self-Supervised Feature Alignment (SSFA). The detector's clean AP and robustness can be improved by aligning the features of the middle layer of the network. We conduct extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets to verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

### 19.3DIoUMatch: Leveraging IoU Prediction for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04355.pdf)
>  3D object detection is an important yet demanding task that heavily relies on difficult to obtain 3D annotations. To reduce the required amount of supervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel method for semi-supervised 3D object detection. We adopt VoteNet, a popular point cloud-based object detector, as our backbone and leverage a teacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the labeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due to the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suffer from significant noise and are thus not directly usable. To that end, we introduce a confidence-based filtering mechanism. The key to our approach is a novel differentiable 3D IoU estimation module. This module is used for filtering poorly localized proposals as well as for IoU-guided bounding box deduplication. At inference time, this module is further utilized to improve localization through test-time optimization. Our method consistently improves state-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by significant margins. For example, when training using only 10\% labeled data on ScanNet, 3DIoUMatch achieves 7.7 absolute improvement on mAP@0.25 and 8.5 absolute improvement on mAP@0.5 upon the prior art.      
### 20.MANGO: A Mask Attention Guided One-Stage Scene Text Spotter  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04350.pdf)
>  Recently end-to-end scene text spotting has become a popular research topic due to its advantages of global optimization and high maintainability in real applications. Most methods attempt to develop various region of interest (RoI) operations to concatenate the detection part and the sequence recognition part into a two-stage text spotting framework. However, in such framework, the recognition part is highly sensitive to the detected results (\emph{e.g.}, the compactness of text contours). To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Mask AttentioN Guided One-stage text spotting framework named MANGO, in which character sequences can be directly recognized without RoI operation. Concretely, a position-aware mask attention module is developed to generate attention weights on each text instance and its characters. It allows different text instances in an image to be allocated on different feature map channels which are further grouped as a batch of instance features. Finally, a lightweight sequence decoder is applied to generate the character sequences. It is worth noting that MANGO inherently adapts to arbitrary-shaped text spotting and can be trained end-to-end with only coarse position information (\emph{e.g.}, rectangular bounding box) and text annotations. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive and even new state-of-the-art performance on both regular and irregular text spotting benchmarks, i.e., ICDAR 2013, ICDAR 2015, Total-Text, and SCUT-CTW1500.      
### 21.StacMR: Scene-Text Aware Cross-Modal Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04329.pdf)
>  Recent models for cross-modal retrieval have benefited from an increasingly rich understanding of visual scenes, afforded by scene graphs and object interactions to mention a few. This has resulted in an improved matching between the visual representation of an image and the textual representation of its caption. Yet, current visual representations overlook a key aspect: the text appearing in images, which may contain crucial information for retrieval. In this paper, we first propose a new dataset that allows exploration of cross-modal retrieval where images contain scene-text instances. Then, armed with this dataset, we describe several approaches which leverage scene text, including a better scene-text aware cross-modal retrieval method which uses specialized representations for text from the captions and text from the visual scene, and reconcile them in a common embedding space. Extensive experiments confirm that cross-modal retrieval approaches benefit from scene text and highlight interesting research questions worth exploring further.

### 22.Continual Adaptation of Visual Representations via Domain Randomization and Meta-learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04324.pdf)
>  Most standard learning approaches lead to fragile models which are prone to drift when sequentially trained on samples of a different nature - the well-known "catastrophic forgetting" issue. In particular, when a model consecutively learns from different visual domains, it tends to forget the past ones in favor of the most recent. In this context, we show that one way to learn models that are inherently more robust against forgetting is domain randomization - for vision tasks, randomizing the current domain's distribution with heavy image manipulations. Building on this result, we devise a meta-learning strategy where a regularizer explicitly penalizes any loss associated with transferring the model from the current domain to different "auxiliary" meta-domains, while also easing adaptation to them. Such meta-domains, are also generated through randomized image manipulations. We empirically demonstrate in a variety of experiments - spanning from classification to semantic segmentation - that our approach results in models that are less prone to catastrophic forgetting when transferred to new domains.      
### 23.Perceptual Robust Hashing for Color Images with Canonical Correlation Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04312.pdf)
>  In this paper, a novel perceptual image hashing scheme for color images is proposed based on ring-ribbon quadtree and color vector angle. First, original image is subjected to normalization and Gaussian low-pass filtering to produce a secondary image, which is divided into a series of ring-ribbons with different radii and the same number of pixels. Then, both textural and color features are extracted locally and globally. Quadtree decomposition (QD) is applied on luminance values of the ring-ribbons to extract local textural features, and the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is used to extract global textural features. Local color features of significant corner points on outer boundaries of ring-ribbons are extracted through color vector angles (CVA), and color low-order moments (CLMs) is utilized to extract global color features. Finally, two types of feature vectors are fused via canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to prodcue the final hash after scrambling. Compared with direct concatenation, the CCA feature fusion method improves classification performance, which better reflects overall correlation between two sets of feature vectors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve shows that our scheme has satisfactory performances with respect to robustness, discrimination and security, which can be effectively used in copy detection and content authentication.      
### 24.Context-Aware Graph Convolution Network for Target Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04298.pdf)
>  Most existing re-identification methods focus on learning ro-bust and discriminative features with deep convolution net-works. However, many of them consider content similarityseparately and fail to utilize the context information of thequery and gallery sets, e.g. probe-gallery and gallery-galleryrelations, thus hard samples may not be well solved due tothe limited or even misleading information. In this paper,we present a novel Context-Aware Graph Convolution Net-work (CAGCN), where the probe-gallery relations are en-coded into the graph nodes and the graph edge connectionsare well controlled by the gallery-gallery relations. In thisway, hard samples can be addressed with the context infor-mation flows among other easy samples during the graph rea-soning. Specifically, we adopt an effective hard gallery sam-pler to obtain high recall for positive samples while keeping areasonable graph size, which can also weaken the imbalancedproblem in training process with low computation complex-ity. Experiments show that the proposed method achievesstate-of-the-art performance on both person and vehicle re-identification datasets in a plug and play fashion with limitedoverhead.      
### 25.Towards Uncovering the Intrinsic Data Structures for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation using Structurally Regularized Deep Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04280.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is to learn classification models that make predictions for unlabeled data on a target domain, given labeled data on a source domain whose distribution diverges from the target one. Mainstream UDA methods strive to learn domain-aligned features such that classifiers trained on the source features can be readily applied to the target ones. Although impressive results have been achieved, these methods have a potential risk of damaging the intrinsic data structures of target discrimination, raising an issue of generalization particularly for UDA tasks in an inductive setting. To address this issue, we are motivated by a UDA assumption of structural similarity across domains, and propose to directly uncover the intrinsic target discrimination via constrained clustering, where we constrain the clustering solutions using structural source regularization that hinges on the very same assumption. Technically, we propose a hybrid model of Structurally Regularized Deep Clustering, which integrates the regularized discriminative clustering of target data with a generative one, and we thus term our method as SRDC++. Our hybrid model is based on a deep clustering framework that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of network prediction and an auxiliary one, where we impose structural regularization by learning domain-shared classifier and cluster centroids. By enriching the structural similarity assumption, we are able to extend SRDC++ for a pixel-level UDA task of semantic segmentation. We conduct extensive experiments on seven UDA benchmarks of image classification and semantic segmentation. With no explicit feature alignment, our proposed SRDC++ outperforms all the existing methods under both the inductive and transductive settings. We make our implementation codes publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/huitangtang/SRDCPP" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 26.UnrealPerson: An Adaptive Pipeline towards Costless Person Re-identification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04268.pdf)
>  The main difficulty of person re-identification (ReID) lies in collecting annotated data and transferring the model across different domains. This paper presents UnrealPerson, a novel pipeline that makes full use of unreal image data to decrease the costs in both the training and deployment stages. Its fundamental part is a system that can generate synthesized images of high-quality and from controllable distributions. Instance-level annotation goes with the synthesized data and is almost free. We point out some details in image synthesis that largely impact the data quality. With 3,000 IDs and 120,000 instances, our method achieves a 38.5% rank-1 accuracy when being directly transferred to MSMT17. It almost doubles the former record using synthesized data and even surpasses previous direct transfer records using real data. This offers a good basis for unsupervised domain adaption, where our pre-trained model is easily plugged into the state-of-the-art algorithms towards higher accuracy. In addition, the data distribution can be flexibly adjusted to fit some corner ReID scenarios, which widens the application of our pipeline. We will publish our data synthesis toolkit and synthesized data in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/FlyHighest/UnrealPerson" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 27.Learning to Generate Content-Aware Dynamic Detectors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04265.pdf)
>  Model efficiency is crucial for object detection. Mostprevious works rely on either hand-crafted design or auto-search methods to obtain a static architecture, regardless ofthe difference of inputs. In this paper, we introduce a newperspective of designing efficient detectors, which is automatically generating sample-adaptive model architectureon the fly. The proposed method is named content-aware dynamic detectors (CADDet). It first applies a multi-scale densely connected network with dynamic routing as the supernet. Furthermore, we introduce a course-to-fine strat-egy tailored for object detection to guide the learning of dynamic routing, which contains two metrics: 1) dynamic global budget constraint assigns data-dependent expectedbudgets for individual samples; 2) local path similarity regularization aims to generate more diverse routing paths. With these, our method achieves higher computational efficiency while maintaining good performance. To the best of our knowledge, our CADDet is the first work to introduce dynamic routing mechanism in object detection. Experiments on MS-COCO dataset demonstrate that CADDet achieves 1.8 higher mAP with 10% fewer FLOPs compared with vanilla routing strategy. Compared with the models based upon similar building blocks, CADDet achieves a 42% FLOPs reduction with a competitive mAP.      
### 28.Active Visual Localization in Partially Calibrated Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04263.pdf)
>  Humans can robustly localize themselves without a map after they get lost following prominent visual cues or landmarks. In this work, we aim at endowing autonomous agents the same ability. Such ability is important in robotics applications yet very challenging when an agent is exposed to partially calibrated environments, where camera images with accurate 6 Degree-of-Freedom pose labels only cover part of the scene. To address the above challenge, we explore using Reinforcement Learning to search for a policy to generate intelligent motions so as to actively localize the agent given visual information in partially calibrated environments. Our core contribution is to formulate the active visual localization problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and propose an algorithmic framework based on Deep Reinforcement Learning to solve it. We further propose an indoor scene dataset ACR-6, which consists of both synthetic and real data and simulates challenging scenarios for active visual localization. We benchmark our algorithm against handcrafted baselines for localization and demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms them on localization success rate.      
### 29.Overcomplete Representations Against Adversarial Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04262.pdf)
>  Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks is an extensively studied problem in the literature and various methods have been proposed to defend against adversarial images. However, only a handful of defense methods have been developed for defending against attacked videos. In this paper, we propose a novel Over-and-Under complete restoration network for Defending against adversarial videos (OUDefend). Most restoration networks adopt an encoder-decoder architecture that first shrinks spatial dimension then expands it back. This approach learns undercomplete representations, which have large receptive fields to collect global information but overlooks local details. On the other hand, overcomplete representations have opposite properties. Hence, OUDefend is designed to balance local and global features by learning those two representations. We attach OUDefend to target video recognition models as a feature restoration block and train the entire network end-to-end. Experimental results show that the defenses focusing on images may be ineffective to videos, while OUDefend enhances robustness against different types of adversarial videos, ranging from additive attacks, multiplicative attacks to physically realizable attacks.      
### 30.Data Instance Prior for Transfer Learning in GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04256.pdf)
>  Recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown remarkable progress in generating high-quality images. However, this gain in performance depends on the availability of a large amount of training data. In limited data regimes, training typically diverges, and therefore the generated samples are of low quality and lack diversity. Previous works have addressed training in low data setting by leveraging transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. We propose a novel transfer learning method for GANs in the limited data domain by leveraging informative data prior derived from self-supervised/supervised pre-trained networks trained on a diverse source domain. We perform experiments on several standard vision datasets using various GAN architectures (BigGAN, SNGAN, StyleGAN2) to demonstrate that the proposed method effectively transfers knowledge to domains with few target images, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of image quality and diversity. We also show the utility of data instance prior in large-scale unconditional image generation and image editing tasks.      
### 31.Variational Interaction Information Maximization for Cross-domain Disentanglement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04251.pdf)
>  Cross-domain disentanglement is the problem of learning representations partitioned into domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, which is a key to successful domain transfer or measuring semantic distance between two domains. Grounded in information theory, we cast the simultaneous learning of domain-invariant and domain-specific representations as a joint objective of multiple information constraints, which does not require adversarial training or gradient reversal layers. We derive a tractable bound of the objective and propose a generative model named Interaction Information Auto-Encoder (IIAE). Our approach reveals insights on the desirable representation for cross-domain disentanglement and its connection to Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). We demonstrate the validity of our model in the image-to-image translation and the cross-domain retrieval tasks. We further show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot sketch based image retrieval task, even without external knowledge. Our implementation is publicly available at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/gr8joo/IIAE" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 32.Texture Transform Attention for Realistic Image Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04242.pdf)
>  Over the last few years, the performance of inpainting to fill missing regions has shown significant improvements by using deep neural networks. Most of inpainting work create a visually plausible structure and texture, however, due to them often generating a blurry result, final outcomes appear unrealistic and make feel heterogeneity. In order to solve this problem, the existing methods have used a patch based solution with deep neural network, however, these methods also cannot transfer the texture properly. Motivated by these observation, we propose a patch based method. Texture Transform Attention network(TTA-Net) that better produces the missing region inpainting with fine details. The task is a single refinement network and takes the form of U-Net architecture that transfers fine texture features of encoder to coarse semantic features of decoder through skip-connection. Texture Transform Attention is used to create a new reassembled texture map using fine textures and coarse semantics that can efficiently transfer texture information as a result. To stabilize training process, we use a VGG feature layer of ground truth and patch discriminator. We evaluate our model end-to-end with the publicly available datasets CelebA-HQ and Places2 and demonstrate that images of higher quality can be obtained to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 33.KNN-enhanced Deep Learning Against Noisy Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04224.pdf)
>  Supervised learning on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is data hungry. Optimizing performance of DNN in the presence of noisy labels has become of paramount importance since collecting a large dataset will usually bring in noisy labels. Inspired by the robustness of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) against data noise, in this work, we propose to apply deep KNN for label cleanup. Our approach leverages DNNs for feature extraction and KNN for ground-truth label inference. We iteratively train the neural network and update labels to simultaneously proceed towards higher label recovery rate and better classification performance. Experiment results show that under the same setting, our approach outperforms existing label correction methods and achieves better accuracy on multiple datasets, e.g.,76.78% on Clothing1M dataset.      
### 34.Scale Aware Adaptation for Land-Cover Classification in Remote Sensing Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04222.pdf)
>  Land-cover classification using remote sensing imagery is an important Earth observation task. Recently, land cover classification has benefited from the development of fully connected neural networks for semantic segmentation. The benchmark datasets available for training deep segmentation models in remote sensing imagery tend to be small, however, often consisting of only a handful of images from a single location with a single scale. This limits the models' ability to generalize to other datasets. Domain adaptation has been proposed to improve the models' generalization but we find these approaches are not effective for dealing with the scale variation commonly found between remote sensing image collections. We therefore propose a scale aware adversarial learning framework to perform joint cross-location and cross-scale land-cover classification. The framework has a dual discriminator architecture with a standard feature discriminator as well as a novel scale discriminator. We also introduce a scale attention module which produces scale-enhanced features. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods by a large margin.      
### 35.Cost Sensitive Optimization of Deepfake Detector  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04199.pdf)
>  Since the invention of cinema, the manipulated videos have existed. But generating manipulated videos that can fool the viewer has been a time-consuming endeavor. With the dramatic improvements in the deep generative modeling, generating believable looking fake videos has become a reality. In the present work, we concentrate on the so-called deepfake videos, where the source face is swapped with the targets. We argue that deepfake detection task should be viewed as a screening task, where the user, such as the video streaming platform, will screen a large number of videos daily. It is clear then that only a small fraction of the uploaded videos are deepfakes, so the detection performance needs to be measured in a cost-sensitive way. Preferably, the model parameters also need to be estimated in the same way. This is precisely what we propose here.      
### 36.VAE-Info-cGAN: Generating Synthetic Images by Combining Pixel-level and Feature-level Geospatial Conditional Inputs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04196.pdf)
>  Training robust supervised deep learning models for many geospatial applications of computer vision is difficult due to dearth of class-balanced and diverse training data. Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many applications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when the application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically generating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a target distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an inexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we present a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing semantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition (PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC can only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant to be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the latent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various characteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. An interpretation of the attribute vector to systematically generate synthetic images by varying a chosen binary macroscopic feature is explored. Experiments on a GPS trajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate various forms of spatio-temporal aggregates across different geographic locations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road network. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic data (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer vision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote sensing.      
### 37.Multi-modal Visual Tracking: Review and Experimental Comparison  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04176.pdf)
>  Visual object tracking, as a fundamental task in computer vision, has drawn much attention in recent years. To extend trackers to a wider range of applications, researchers have introduced information from multiple modalities to handle specific scenes, which is a promising research prospect with emerging methods and benchmarks. To provide a thorough review of multi-modal track-ing, we summarize the multi-modal tracking algorithms, especially visible-depth (RGB-D) tracking and visible-thermal (RGB-T) tracking in a unified taxonomy from different aspects. Second, we provide a detailed description of the related benchmarks and challenges. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effectiveness of trackers on five datasets: PTB, VOT19-RGBD, GTOT, RGBT234, and VOT19-RGBT. Finally, we discuss various future directions from different perspectives, including model design and dataset construction for further research.      
### 38.Weakly-Supervised Cross-Domain Adaptation for Endoscopic Lesions Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04170.pdf)
>  Weakly-supervised learning has attracted growing research attention on medical lesions segmentation due to significant saving in pixel-level annotation cost. However, 1) most existing methods require effective prior and constraints to explore the intrinsic lesions characterization, which only generates incorrect and rough prediction; 2) they neglect the underlying semantic dependencies among weakly-labeled target enteroscopy diseases and fully-annotated source gastroscope lesions, while forcefully utilizing untransferable dependencies leads to the negative performance. To tackle above issues, we propose a new weakly-supervised lesions transfer framework, which can not only explore transferable domain-invariant knowledge across different datasets, but also prevent the negative transfer of untransferable representations. Specifically, a Wasserstein quantified transferability framework is developed to highlight widerange transferable contextual dependencies, while neglecting the irrelevant semantic characterizations. Moreover, a novel selfsupervised pseudo label generator is designed to equally provide confident pseudo pixel labels for both hard-to-transfer and easyto-transfer target samples. It inhibits the enormous deviation of false pseudo pixel labels under the self-supervision manner. Afterwards, dynamically-searched feature centroids are aligned to narrow category-wise distribution shift. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments show the superiority of our model on the endoscopic dataset and several public datasets.      
### 39.Learning Independent Instance Maps for Crowd Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04164.pdf)
>  Accurately locating each head's position in the crowd scenes is a crucial task in the field of crowd analysis. However, traditional density-based methods only predict coarse prediction, and segmentation/detection-based methods cannot handle extremely dense scenes and large-range scale-variations crowds. To this end, we propose an end-to-end and straightforward framework for crowd localization, named Independent Instance Map segmentation (IIM). Different from density maps and boxes regression, each instance in IIM is non-overlapped. By segmenting crowds into independent connected components, the positions and the crowd counts (the centers and the number of components, respectively) are obtained. Furthermore, to improve the segmentation quality for different density regions, we present a differentiable Binarization Module (BM) to output structured instance maps. BM brings two advantages into localization models: 1) adaptively learn a threshold map for different images to detect each instance more accurately; 2) directly train the model using loss on binary predictions and labels. Extensive experiments verify the proposed method is effective and outperforms the-state-of-the-art methods on the five popular crowd datasets. Significantly, IIM improves F1-measure by 10.4\% on the NWPU-Crowd Localization task. The source code and pre-trained models will be released at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/taohan10200/IIM" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 40.Learning Portrait Style Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04153.pdf)
>  Style analysis of artwork in computer vision predominantly focuses on achieving results in target image generation through optimizing understanding of low level style characteristics such as brush strokes. However, fundamentally different techniques are required to computationally understand and control qualities of art which incorporate higher level style characteristics. We study style representations learned by neural network architectures incorporating these higher level characteristics. We find variation in learned style features from incorporating triplets annotated by art historians as supervision for style similarity. Networks leveraging statistical priors or pretrained on photo collections such as ImageNet can also derive useful visual representations of artwork. We align the impact of these expert human knowledge, statistical, and photo realism priors on style representations with art historical research and use these representations to perform zero-shot classification of artists. To facilitate this work, we also present the first large-scale dataset of portraits prepared for computational analysis.      
### 41.Dynamic Anchor Learning for Arbitrary-Oriented Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04150.pdf)
>  Arbitrary-oriented objects widely appear in natural scenes, aerial photographs, remote sensing images, etc., thus arbitrary-oriented object detection has received considerable attention. Many current rotation detectors use plenty of anchors with different orientations to achieve spatial alignment with ground truth boxes, then Intersection-over-Union (IoU) is applied to sample the positive and negative candidates for training. However, we observe that the selected positive anchors cannot always ensure accurate detections after regression, while some negative samples can achieve accurate localization. It indicates that the quality assessment of anchors through IoU is not appropriate, and this further lead to inconsistency between classification confidence and localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a dynamic anchor learning (DAL) method, which utilizes the newly defined matching degree to comprehensively evaluate the localization potential of the anchors and carry out a more efficient label assignment process. In this way, the detector can dynamically select high-quality anchors to achieve accurate object detection, and the divergence between classification and regression will be alleviated. With the newly introduced DAL, we achieve superior detection performance for arbitrary-oriented objects with only a few horizontal preset anchors. Experimental results on three remote sensing datasets HRSC2016, DOTA, UCAS-AOD as well as a scene text dataset ICDAR 2015 show that our method achieves substantial improvement compared with the baseline model. Besides, our approach is also universal for object detection using horizontal bound box.

### 42.Performance Analysis of Keypoint Detectors and Binary Descriptors Under Varying Degrees of Photometric and Geometric Transformations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04135.pdf)
>  Detecting image correspondences by feature matching forms the basis of numerous computer vision applications. Several detectors and descriptors have been presented in the past, addressing the efficient generation of features from interest points (keypoints) in an image. In this paper, we investigate eight binary descriptors (AKAZE, BoostDesc, BRIEF, BRISK, FREAK, LATCH, LUCID, and ORB) and eight interest point detector (AGAST, AKAZE, BRISK, FAST, HarrisLapalce, KAZE, ORB, and StarDetector). We have decoupled the detection and description phase to analyze the interest point detectors and then evaluate the performance of the pairwise combination of different detectors and descriptors. We conducted experiments on a standard dataset and analyzed the comparative performance of each method under different image transformations. We observed that: (1) the FAST, AGAST, ORB detectors were faster and detected more keypoints, (2) the AKAZE and KAZE detectors performed better under photometric changes while ORB was more robust against geometric changes, (3) in general, descriptors performed better when paired with the KAZE and AKAZE detectors, (4) the BRIEF, LUCID, ORB descriptors were relatively faster, and (5) none of the descriptors did particularly well under geometric transformations, only BRISK, FREAK, and AKAZE showed reasonable resiliency.      
### 43.Parameter Efficient Multimodal Transformers for Video Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04124.pdf)
>  The recent success of Transformers in the language domain has motivated adapting it to a multimodal setting, where a new visual model is trained in tandem with an already pretrained language model. However, due to the excessive memory requirements from Transformers, existing work typically fixes the language model and train only the vision module, which limits its ability to learn cross-modal information in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we focus on reducing the parameters of multimodal Transformers in the context of audio-visual video representation learning. We alleviate the high memory requirement by sharing the weights of Transformers across layers and modalities; we decompose the Transformer into modality-specific and modality-shared parts so that the model learns the dynamics of each modality both individually and together, and propose a novel parameter sharing scheme based on low-rank approximation. We show that our approach reduces parameters up to 80$\%$, allowing us to train our model end-to-end from scratch. We also propose a negative sampling approach based on an instance similarity measured on the CNN embedding space that our model learns with the Transformers. To demonstrate our approach, we pretrain our model on 30-second clips from Kinetics-700 and transfer it to audio-visual classification tasks.      
### 44.SuperFront: From Low-resolution to High-resolution Frontal Face Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04111.pdf)
>  Advances in face rotation, along with other face-based generative tasks, are more frequent as we advance further in topics of deep learning. Even as impressive milestones are achieved in synthesizing faces, the importance of preserving identity is needed in practice and should not be overlooked. Also, the difficulty should not be more for data with obscured faces, heavier poses, and lower quality. Existing methods tend to focus on samples with variation in pose, but with the assumption data is high in quality. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) -based model to generate high-quality, identity preserving frontal faces from one or multiple low-resolution (LR) faces with extreme poses. Specifically, we propose SuperFront-GAN (SF-GAN) to synthesize a high-resolution (HR), frontal face from one-to-many LR faces with various poses and with the identity-preserved. We integrate a super-resolution (SR) side-view module into SF-GAN to preserve identity information and fine details of the side-views in HR space, which helps model reconstruct high-frequency information of faces (i.e., periocular, nose, and mouth regions). Moreover, SF-GAN accepts multiple LR faces as input, and improves each added sample. We squeeze additional gain in performance with an orthogonal constraint in the generator to penalize redundant latent representations and, hence, diversify the learned features space. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the superiority of SF-GAN over others.      
### 45.Deformable Gabor Feature Networks for Biomedical Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04109.pdf)
>  In recent years, deep learning has dominated progress in the field of medical image analysis. We find however, that the ability of current deep learning approaches to represent the complex geometric structures of many medical images is insufficient. One limitation is that deep learning models require a tremendous amount of data, and it is very difficult to obtain a sufficient amount with the necessary detail. A second limitation is that there are underlying features of these medical images that are well established, but the black-box nature of existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do not allow us to exploit them. In this paper, we revisit Gabor filters and introduce a deformable Gabor convolution (DGConv) to expand deep networks interpretability and enable complex spatial variations. The features are learned at deformable sampling locations with adaptive Gabor convolutions to improve representativeness and robustness to complex objects. The DGConv replaces standard convolutional layers and is easily trained end-to-end, resulting in deformable Gabor feature network (DGFN) with few additional parameters and minimal additional training cost. We introduce DGFN for addressing deep multi-instance multi-label classification on the INbreast dataset for mammograms and on the ChestX-ray14 dataset for pulmonary x-ray images.      
### 46.A New Window Loss Function for Bone Fracture Detection and Localization in X-ray Images with Point-based Annotation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04066.pdf)
>  Object detection methods are widely adopted for computer-aided diagnosis using medical images. Anomalous findings are usually treated as objects that are described by bounding boxes. Yet, many pathological findings, e.g., bone fractures, cannot be clearly defined by bounding boxes, owing to considerable instance, shape and boundary ambiguities. This makes bounding box annotations, and their associated losses, highly ill-suited. In this work, we propose a new bone fracture detection method for X-ray images, based on a labor effective and flexible annotation scheme suitable for abnormal findings with no clear object-level spatial extents or boundaries. Our method employs a simple, intuitive, and informative point-based annotation protocol to mark localized pathology information. To address the uncertainty in the fracture scales annotated via point(s), we convert the annotations into pixel-wise supervision that uses lower and upper bounds with positive, negative, and uncertain regions. A novel Window Loss is subsequently proposed to only penalize the predictions outside of the uncertain regions. Our method has been extensively evaluated on 4410 pelvic X-ray images of unique patients. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art image classification and object detection baselines by healthy margins, with an AUROC of 0.983 and FROC score of 89.6%.      
### 47.Semantic and Geometric Modeling with Neural Message Passing in 3D Scene Graphs for Hierarchical Mechanical Search  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04060.pdf)
>  Searching for objects in indoor organized environments such as homes or offices is part of our everyday activities. When looking for a target object, we jointly reason about the rooms and containers the object is likely to be in; the same type of container will have a different probability of having the target depending on the room it is in. We also combine geometric and semantic information to infer what container is best to search, or what other objects are best to move, if the target object is hidden from view. We propose to use a 3D scene graph representation to capture the hierarchical, semantic, and geometric aspects of this problem. To exploit this representation in a search process, we introduce Hierarchical Mechanical Search (HMS), a method that guides an agent's actions towards finding a target object specified with a natural language description. HMS is based on a novel neural network architecture that uses neural message passing of vectors with visual, geometric, and linguistic information to allow HMS to reason across layers of the graph while combining semantic and geometric cues. HMS is evaluated on a novel dataset of 500 3D scene graphs with dense placements of semantically related objects in storage locations, and is shown to be significantly better than several baselines at finding objects and close to the oracle policy in terms of the median number of actions required. Additional qualitative results can be found at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://ai.stanford.edu/mech-search/hms" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 48.Rotation-Invariant Point Convolution With Multiple Equivariant Alignments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04048.pdf)
>  Recent attempts at introducing rotation invariance or equivariance in 3D deep learning approaches have shown promising results, but these methods still struggle to reach the performances of standard 3D neural networks. In this work we study the relation between equivariance and invariance in 3D point convolutions. We show that using rotation-equivariant alignments, it is possible to make any convolutional layer rotation-invariant. Furthermore, we improve this simple alignment procedure by using the alignment themselves as features in the convolution, and by combining multiple alignments together. With this core layer, we design rotation-invariant architectures which improve state-of-the-art results in both object classification and semantic segmentation and reduces the gap between rotation-invariant and standard 3D deep learning approaches.      
### 49.Generating unseen complex scenes: are we there yet?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04027.pdf)
>  Although recent complex scene conditional generation models generate increasingly appealing scenes, it is very hard to assess which models perform better and why. This is often due to models being trained to fit different data splits, and defining their own experimental setups. In this paper, we propose a methodology to compare complex scene conditional generation models, and provide an in-depth analysis that assesses the ability of each model to (1) fit the training distribution and hence perform well on seen conditionings, (2) to generalize to unseen conditionings composed of seen object combinations, and (3) generalize to unseen conditionings composed of unseen object combinations. As a result, we observe that recent methods are able to generate recognizable scenes given seen conditionings, and exploit compositionality to generalize to unseen conditionings with seen object combinations. However, all methods suffer from noticeable image quality degradation when asked to generate images from conditionings composed of unseen object combinations. Moreover, through our analysis, we identify the advantages of different pipeline components, and find that (1) encouraging compositionality through instance-wise spatial conditioning normalizations increases robustness to both types of unseen conditionings, (2) using semantically aware losses such as the scene-graph perceptual similarity helps improve some dimensions of the generation process, and (3) enhancing the quality of generated masks and the quality of the individual objects are crucial steps to improve robustness to both types of unseen conditionings.      
### 50.Learning an Animatable Detailed 3D Face Model from In-The-Wild Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04012.pdf)
>  While current monocular 3D face reconstruction methods can recover fine geometric details, they suffer several limitations. Some methods produce faces that cannot be realistically animated because they do not model how wrinkles vary with expression. Other methods are trained on high-quality face scans and do not generalize well to in-the-wild images. We present the first approach to jointly learn a model with animatable detail and a detailed 3D face regressor from in-the-wild images that recovers shape details as well as their relationship to facial expressions. Our DECA (Detailed Expression Capture and Animation) model is trained to robustly produce a UV displacement map from a low-dimensional latent representation that consists of person-specific detail parameters and generic expression parameters, while a regressor is trained to predict detail, shape, albedo, expression, pose and illumination parameters from a single image. We introduce a novel detail-consistency loss to disentangle person-specific details and expression-dependent wrinkles. This disentanglement allows us to synthesize realistic person-specific wrinkles by controlling expression parameters while keeping person-specific details unchanged. DECA achieves state-of-the-art shape reconstruction accuracy on two benchmarks. Qualitative results on in-the-wild data demonstrate DECA's robustness and its ability to disentangle identity and expression dependent details enabling animation of reconstructed faces.

### 51.GenScan: A Generative Method for Populating Parametric 3D Scan Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03998.pdf)
>  The availability of rich 3D datasets corresponding to the geometrical complexity of the built environments is considered an ongoing challenge for 3D deep learning methodologies. To address this challenge, we introduce GenScan, a generative system that populates synthetic 3D scan datasets in a parametric fashion. The system takes an existing captured 3D scan as an input and outputs alternative variations of the building layout including walls, doors, and furniture with corresponding textures. GenScan is a fully automated system that can also be manually controlled by a user through an assigned user interface. Our proposed system utilizes a combination of a hybrid deep neural network and a parametrizer module to extract and transform elements of a given 3D scan. GenScan takes advantage of style transfer techniques to generate new textures for the generated scenes. We believe our system would facilitate data augmentation to expand the currently limited 3D geometry datasets commonly used in 3D computer vision, generative design, and general 3D deep learning tasks.      
### 52.Shape From Tracing: Towards Reconstructing 3D Object Geometry and SVBRDF Material from Images via Differentiable Path Tracing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.03939.pdf)
>  Reconstructing object geometry and material from multiple views typically requires optimization. Differentiable path tracing is an appealing framework as it can reproduce complex appearance effects. However, it is difficult to use due to high computational cost. In this paper, we explore how to use differentiable ray tracing to refine an initial coarse mesh and per-mesh-facet material representation. In simulation, we find that it is possible to reconstruct fine geometric and material detail from low resolution input views, allowing high-quality reconstructions in a few hours despite the expense of path tracing. The reconstructions successfully disambiguate shading, shadow, and global illumination effects such as diffuse interreflection from material properties. We demonstrate the impact of different geometry initializations, including space carving, multi-view stereo, and 3D neural networks. Finally, with input captured using smartphone video and a consumer 360? camera for lighting estimation, we also show how to refine initial reconstructions of real-world objects in unconstrained environments.      
### 53.Globetrotter: Unsupervised Multilingual Translation from Visual Alignment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04631.pdf)
>  Multi-language machine translation without parallel corpora is challenging because there is no explicit supervision between languages. Existing unsupervised methods typically rely on topological properties of the language representations. We introduce a framework that instead uses the visual modality to align multiple languages, using images as the bridge between them. We estimate the cross-modal alignment between language and images, and use this estimate to guide the learning of cross-lingual representations. Our language representations are trained jointly in one model with a single stage. Experiments with fifty-two languages show that our method outperforms baselines on unsupervised word-level and sentence-level translation using retrieval.      
### 54.Generalized iterated-sums signatures  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04597.pdf)
>  We explore the algebraic properties of a generalized version of the iterated-sums signature, inspired by previous work of F.~Király and H.~Oberhauser. In particular, we show how to recover the character property of the associated linear map over the tensor algebra by considering a deformed quasi-shuffle product of words on the latter. We introduce three non-linear transformations on iterated-sums signatures, close in spirit to Machine Learning applications, and show some of their properties.      
### 55.Hierarchical Residual Attention Network for Single Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04578.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks are the most successful models in single image super-resolution. Deeper networks, residual connections, and attention mechanisms have further improved their performance. However, these strategies often improve the reconstruction performance at the expense of considerably increasing the computational cost. This paper introduces a new lightweight super-resolution model based on an efficient method for residual feature and attention aggregation. In order to make an efficient use of the residual features, these are hierarchically aggregated into feature banks for posterior usage at the network output. In parallel, a lightweight hierarchical attention mechanism extracts the most relevant features from the network into attention banks for improving the final output and preventing the information loss through the successive operations inside the network. Therefore, the processing is split into two independent paths of computation that can be simultaneously carried out, resulting in a highly efficient and effective model for reconstructing fine details on high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts. Our proposed architecture surpasses state-of-the-art performance in several datasets, while maintaining relatively low computation and memory footprint.      
### 56.GMM-Based Generative Adversarial Encoder Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04525.pdf)
>  While GAN is a powerful model for generating images, its inability to infer a latent space directly limits its use in applications requiring an encoder. Our paper presents a simple architectural setup that combines the generative capabilities of GAN with an encoder. We accomplish this by combining the encoder with the discriminator using shared weights, then training them simultaneously using a new loss term. We model the output of the encoder latent space via a GMM, which leads to both good clustering using this latent space and improved image generation by the GAN. Our framework is generic and can be easily plugged into any GAN strategy. In particular, we demonstrate it both with Vanilla GAN and Wasserstein GAN, where in both it leads to an improvement in the generated images in terms of both the IS and FID scores. Moreover, we show that our encoder learns a meaningful representation as its clustering results are competitive with the current GAN-based state-of-the-art in clustering.      
### 57.Multi-temporal and multi-source remote sensing image classification by nonlinear relative normalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04469.pdf)
>  Remote sensing image classification exploiting multiple sensors is a very challenging problem: data from different modalities are affected by spectral distortions and mis-alignments of all kinds, and this hampers re-using models built for one image to be used successfully in other scenes. In order to adapt and transfer models across image acquisitions, one must be able to cope with datasets that are not co-registered, acquired under different illumination and atmospheric conditions, by different sensors, and with scarce ground references. Traditionally, methods based on histogram matching have been used. However, they fail when densities have very different shapes or when there is no corresponding band to be matched between the images. An alternative builds upon \emph{manifold alignment}. Manifold alignment performs a multidimensional relative normalization of the data prior to product generation that can cope with data of different dimensionality (e.g. different number of bands) and possibly unpaired examples. Aligning data distributions is an appealing strategy, since it allows to provide data spaces that are more similar to each other, regardless of the subsequent use of the transformed data. In this paper, we study a methodology that aligns data from different domains in a nonlinear way through {\em kernelization}. We introduce the Kernel Manifold Alignment (KEMA) method, which provides a flexible and discriminative projection map, exploits only a few labeled samples (or semantic ties) in each domain, and reduces to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. We successfully test KEMA in multi-temporal and multi-source very high resolution classification tasks, as well as on the task of making a model invariant to shadowing for hyperspectral imaging.      
### 58.Active Learning Methods for Efficient Hybrid Biophysical Variable Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04468.pdf)
>  Kernel-based machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) are potentially powerful methods for being implemented into operational biophysical variable retrieval schemes. However, they face difficulties in coping with large training datasets. With the increasing amount of optical remote sensing data made available for analysis and the possibility of using a large amount of simulated data from radiative transfer models (RTMs) to train kernel MLRAs, efficient data reduction techniques will need to be implemented. Active learning (AL) methods enable to select the most informative samples in a dataset. This letter introduces six AL methods for achieving optimized biophysical variable estimation with a manageable training dataset, and their implementation into a Matlab-based MLRA toolbox for semi-automatic use. The AL methods were analyzed on their efficiency of improving the estimation accuracy of leaf area index and chlorophyll content based on PROSAIL simulations. Each of the implemented methods outperformed random sampling, improving retrieval accuracy with lower sampling rates. Practically, AL methods open opportunities to feed advanced MLRAs with RTM-generated training data for development of operational retrieval models.      
### 59.Planet cartography with neural learned regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04460.pdf)
>  Finding potential life harboring exo-Earths is one of the aims of exoplanetary science. Detecting signatures of life in exoplanets will likely first be accomplished by determining the bulk composition of the planetary atmosphere via reflected/transmitted spectroscopy. However, a complete understanding of the habitability conditions will surely require mapping the presence of liquid water, continents and/or clouds. Spin-orbit tomography is a technique that allows us to obtain maps of the surface of exoplanets around other stars using the light scattered by the planetary surface. We leverage the potential of deep learning and propose a mapping technique for exo-Earths in which the regularization is learned from mock surfaces. The solution of the inverse mapping problem is posed as a deep neural network that can be trained end-to-end with suitable training data. We propose in this work to use methods based on the procedural generation of planets, inspired by what we found on Earth. We also consider mapping the recovery of surfaces and the presence of persistent cloud in cloudy planets. We show that the a reliable mapping can be carried out with our approach, producing very compact continents, even when using single passband observations. More importantly, if exoplanets are partially cloudy like the Earth is, we show that one can potentially map the distribution of persistent clouds that always occur on the same position on the surface (associated to orography and sea surface temperatures) together with non-persistent clouds that move across the surface. This will become the first test one can perform on an exoplanet for the detection of an active climate system. For small rocky planets in the habitable zone of their stars, this weather system will be driven by water, and the detection can be considered as a strong proxy for truly habitable conditions.      
### 60.Reinforcement Based Learning on Classification Task Could Yield Better Generalization and Adversarial Accuracy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04353.pdf)
>  Deep Learning has become interestingly popular in computer vision, mostly attaining near or above human-level performance in various vision tasks. But recent work has also demonstrated that these deep neural networks are very vulnerable to adversarial examples (adversarial examples - inputs to a model which are naturally similar to original data but fools the model in classifying it into a wrong class). Humans are very robust against such perturbations; one possible reason could be that humans do not learn to classify based on an error between "target label" and "predicted label" but possibly due to reinforcements that they receive on their predictions. In this work, we proposed a novel method to train deep learning models on an image classification task. We used a reward-based optimization function, similar to the vanilla policy gradient method used in reinforcement learning, to train our model instead of conventional cross-entropy loss. An empirical evaluation on the cifar10 dataset showed that our method learns a more robust classifier than the same model architecture trained using cross-entropy loss function (on adversarial training). At the same time, our method shows a better generalization with the difference in test accuracy and train accuracy $&lt; 2\%$ for most of the time compared to the cross-entropy one, whose difference most of the time remains $&gt; 2\%$.      
### 61.Two-Phase Learning for Overcoming Noisy Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04337.pdf)
>  To counter the challenge associated with noise labels, the learning strategy of deep neural networks must be differentiated over the learning period during the training process. Therefore, we propose a novel two-phase learning method, MORPH, which automatically transitions its learning phase at the point when the network begins to rapidly memorize false-labeled samples. In the first phase, MORPH starts to update the network for all the training samples before the transition point. Without any supervision, the learning phase is converted to the next phase on the basis of the estimated best transition point. Subsequently, MORPH resumes the training of the network only for a maximal safe set, which maintains the collection of almost certainly true-labeled samples at each epoch. Owing to its two-phase learning, MORPH realizes noise-free training for any type of label noise for practical use. Moreover, extensive experiments using six datasets verify that MORPH significantly outperforms five state-of-the art methods in terms of test error and training time.      
### 62.Interpretable deep learning regression for breast density estimation on MRI  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04336.pdf)
>  Breast density, which is the ratio between fibroglandular tissue (FGT) and total breast volume, can be assessed qualitatively by radiologists and quantitatively by computer algorithms. These algorithms often rely on segmentation of breast and FGT volume. In this study, we propose a method to directly assess breast density on MRI, and provide interpretations of these assessments. <br>We assessed breast density in 506 patients with breast cancer using a regression convolutional neural network (CNN). The input for the CNN were slices of breast MRI of 128 x 128 voxels, and the output was a continuous density value between 0 (fatty breast) and 1 (dense breast). We used 350 patients to train the CNN, 75 for validation, and 81 for independent testing. We investigated why the CNN came to its predicted density using Deep SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). <br>The density predicted by the CNN on the testing set was significantly correlated with the ground truth densities (N = 81 patients, Spearman's rho = 0.86, P &lt; 0.001). When inspecting what the CNN based its predictions on, we found that voxels in FGT commonly had positive SHAP-values, voxels in fatty tissue commonly had negative SHAP-values, and voxels in non-breast tissue commonly had SHAP-values near zero. This means that the prediction of density is based on the structures we expect it to be based on, namely FGT and fatty tissue. <br>To conclude, we presented an interpretable deep learning regression method for breast density estimation on MRI with promising results.      
### 63.CRAFT: A Benchmark for Causal Reasoning About Forces and inTeractions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04293.pdf)
>  Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence and deep learning have revived the interest in studying the gap between the reasoning capabilities of humans and machines. In this ongoing work, we introduce CRAFT, a new visual question answering dataset that requires causal reasoning about physical forces and object interactions. It contains 38K video and question pairs that are generated from 3K videos from 10 different virtual environments, containing different number of objects in motion that interact with each other. Two question categories from CRAFT include previously studied descriptive and counterfactual questions. Besides, inspired by the theory of force dynamics from the field of human cognitive psychology, we introduce new question categories that involve understanding the intentions of objects through the notions of cause, enable, and prevent. Our preliminary results demonstrate that even though these tasks are very intuitive for humans, the implemented baselines could not cope with the underlying challenges.      
### 64.Raw Image Deblurring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04264.pdf)
>  Deep learning-based blind image deblurring plays an essential role in solving image blur since all existing kernels are limited in modeling the real world blur. Thus far, researchers focus on powerful models to handle the deblurring problem and achieve decent results. For this work, in a new aspect, we discover the great opportunity for image enhancement (e.g., deblurring) directly from RAW images and investigate novel neural network structures benefiting RAW-based learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no available RAW image deblurring dataset. Therefore, we built a new dataset containing both RAW images and processed sRGB images and design a new model to utilize the unique characteristics of RAW images. The proposed deblurring model, trained solely from RAW images, achieves the state-of-art performance and outweighs those trained on processed sRGB images. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, the proposed model, trained on our new dataset, can generalize to other sensors. Additionally, by a series of experiments, we demonstrate that existing deblurring models can also be improved by training on the RAW images in our new dataset. Ultimately, we show a new venue for further opportunities based on the devised novel raw-based deblurring method and the brand-new Deblur-RAW dataset.      
### 65.A Unifying Framework for Formal Theories of Novelty:Framework, Examples and Discussion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04226.pdf)
>  Managing inputs that are novel, unknown, or out-of-distribution is critical as an agent moves from the lab to the open world. Novelty-related problems include being tolerant to novel perturbations of the normal input, detecting when the input includes novel items, and adapting to novel inputs. While significant research has been undertaken in these areas, a noticeable gap exists in the lack of a formalized definition of novelty that transcends problem domains. As a team of researchers spanning multiple research groups and different domains, we have seen, first hand, the difficulties that arise from ill-specified novelty problems, as well as inconsistent definitions and terminology. Therefore, we present the first unified framework for formal theories of novelty and use the framework to formally define a family of novelty types. Our framework can be applied across a wide range of domains, from symbolic AI to reinforcement learning, and beyond to open world image recognition. Thus, it can be used to help kick-start new research efforts and accelerate ongoing work on these important novelty-related problems. This extended version of our AAAI 2021 paper included more details and examples in multiple domains.      
### 66.Efficient Estimation of Influence of a Training Instance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04207.pdf)
>  Understanding the influence of a training instance on a neural network model leads to improving interpretability. However, it is difficult and inefficient to evaluate the influence, which shows how a model's prediction would be changed if a training instance were not used. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for estimating the influence. Our method is inspired by dropout, which zero-masks a sub-network and prevents the sub-network from learning each training instance. By switching between dropout masks, we can use sub-networks that learned or did not learn each training instance and estimate its influence. Through experiments with BERT and VGGNet on classification datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method can capture training influences, enhance the interpretability of error predictions, and cleanse the training dataset for improving generalization.      
### 67.A Number Sense as an Emergent Property of the Manipulating Brain  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04132.pdf)
>  The ability to understand and manipulate numbers and quantities emerges during childhood, but the mechanism through which this ability is developed is still poorly understood. In particular, it is not known whether acquiring such a {\em number sense} is possible without supervision from a teacher. <br>To explore this question, we propose a model in which spontaneous and undirected manipulation of small objects trains perception to predict the resulting scene changes. We find that, from this task, an image representation emerges that exhibits regularities that foreshadow numbers and quantity. These include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a notion of order, and a signal that correlates with numerical quantity. As a result, our model acquires the ability to estimate the number of objects in the scene, as well as {\em subitization}, i.e. the ability to recognize at a glance the exact number of objects in small scenes. We conclude that important aspects of a facility with numbers and quantities may be learned without explicit teacher supervision.      
### 68.CEL-Net: Continuous Exposure for Extreme Low-Light Imaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.04112.pdf)
>  Deep learning methods for enhancing dark images learn a mapping from input images to output images with pre-determined discrete exposure levels. Often, at inference time the input and optimal output exposure levels of the given image are different from the seen ones during training. As a result the enhanced image might suffer from visual distortions, such as low contrast or dark areas. We address this issue by introducing a deep learning model that can continuously generalize at inference time to unseen exposure levels without the need to retrain the model. To this end, we introduce a dataset of 1500 raw images captured in both outdoor and indoor scenes, with five different exposure levels and various camera parameters. Using the dataset, we develop a model for extreme low-light imaging that can continuously tune the input or output exposure level of the image to an unseen one. We investigate the properties of our model and validate its performance, showing promising results.      
### 69.Process of image super-resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08396.pdf)
>  In this paper we explain a process of super-resolution reconstruction allowing to increase the resolution of an image.The need for high-resolution digital images exists in diverse domains, for example the medical and spatial domains. The obtaining of high-resolution digital images can be made at the time of the shooting, but it is often synonymic of important costs because of the necessary material to avoid such costs, it is known how to use methods of super-resolution reconstruction, consisting from one or several low resolution images to obtain a high-resolution image. The american patent US 9208537 describes such an algorithm. A zone of one low-resolution image is isolated and categorized according to the information contained in pixels forming the borders of the zone. The category of it zone determines the type of interpolation used to add pixels in aforementioned zone, to increase the neatness of the images. It is also known how to reconstruct a low-resolution image there high-resolution image by using a model of super-resolution reconstruction whose learning is based on networks of neurons and on image or a picture library. The demand of chinese patent CN 107563965 and the scientist publication "Pixel Recursive Super Resolution", R. Dahl, M. Norouzi, J. Shlens propose such methods. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct coherent human faces from very degraded pixelated images with a very fast algorithm, more faster than compressed sensing (CS), easier to compute and without deep learning, so without important technology resources, i.e. a large database of thousands training images (see arXiv:2003). <br>This technological breakthrough has been patented in 2018 with the demand of French patent FR 1855485 (<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/FR3082980A1" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>, see the HAL reference <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01875898v1" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>).
