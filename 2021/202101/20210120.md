### 1.Hyperdimensional computing as a framework for systematic aggregation of image descriptors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07720.pdf)
>  Image and video descriptors are an omnipresent tool in computer vision and its application fields like mobile robotics. Many hand-crafted and in particular learned image descriptors are numerical vectors with a potentially (very) large number of dimensions. Practical considerations like memory consumption or time for comparisons call for the creation of compact representations. In this paper, we use hyperdimensional computing (HDC) as an approach to systematically combine information from a set of vectors in a single vector of the same dimensionality. HDC is a known technique to perform symbolic processing with distributed representation in numerical vectors with thousands of dimensions. We present a HDC implementation that is suitable for processing the output of existing and future (deep-learning based) image descriptors. We discuss how this can be used as a framework to process descriptors together with additional knowledge by simple and fast vector operations. A concrete outcome is a novel HDC-based approach to aggregate a set of local image descriptors together with their image positions in a single holistic descriptor. The comparison to available holistic descriptors and aggregation methods on a series of standard mobile robotics place recognition experiments shows a 20% improvement in average performance compared to runner-up and 3.6x better worst-case performance.      
### 2.Deep Feedback Inverse Problem Solver  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07719.pdf)
>  We present an efficient, effective, and generic approach towards solving inverse problems. The key idea is to leverage the feedback signal provided by the forward process and learn an iterative update model. Specifically, at each iteration, the neural network takes the feedback as input and outputs an update on the current estimation. Our approach does not have any restrictions on the forward process; it does not require any prior knowledge either. Through the feedback information, our model not only can produce accurate estimations that are coherent to the input observation but also is capable of recovering from early incorrect predictions. We verify the performance of our approach over a wide range of inverse problems, including 6-DOF pose estimation, illumination estimation, as well as inverse kinematics. Comparing to traditional optimization-based methods, we can achieve comparable or better performance while being two to three orders of magnitude faster. Compared to deep learning-based approaches, our model consistently improves the performance on all metrics.

### 3.Hyperspectral Image Restoration via Multi-mode and Double-weighted Tensor Nuclear Norm Minimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07681.pdf)
>  Tensor nuclear norm (TNN) induced by tensor singular value decomposition plays an important role in hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks. In this letter, we first consider three inconspicuous but crucial phenomenons in TNN. In the Fourier transform domain of HSIs, different frequency components contain different information; different singular values of each frequency component also represent different information. The two physical phenomenons lie not only in the spectral dimension but also in the spatial dimensions. Then, to improve the capability and flexibility of TNN for HSI restoration, we propose a multi-mode and double-weighted TNN based on the above three crucial phenomenons. It can adaptively shrink the frequency components and singular values according to their physical meanings in all modes of HSIs. In the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers, we design an effective alternating iterative strategy to optimize our proposed model. Restoration experiments on both synthetic and real HSI datasets demonstrate their superiority against related methods.      
### 4.Salient Object Detection via Integrity Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07663.pdf)
>  Albeit current salient object detection (SOD) works have achieved fantastic progress, they are cast into the shade when it comes to the integrity of the predicted salient regions. We define the concept of integrity at both the micro and macro level. Specifically, at the micro level, the model should highlight all parts that belong to a certain salient object, while at the macro level, the model needs to discover all salient objects from the given image scene. To facilitate integrity learning for salient object detection, we design a novel Integrity Cognition Network (ICON), which explores three important components to learn strong integrity features. 1) Unlike the existing models that focus more on feature discriminability, we introduce a diverse feature aggregation (DFA) component to aggregate features with various receptive fields (i.e.,, kernel shape and context) and increase the feature diversity. Such diversity is the foundation for mining the integral salient objects. 2) Based on the DFA features, we introduce the integrity channel enhancement (ICE) component with the goal of enhancing feature channels that highlight the integral salient objects at the macro level, while suppressing the other distracting ones. 3) After extracting the enhanced features, the part-whole verification (PWV) method is employed to determine whether the part and whole object features have strong agreement. Such part-whole agreements can further improve the micro-level integrity for each salient object. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ICON, comprehensive experiments are conducted on seven challenging benchmarks, where promising results are achieved.      
### 5.Human Action Recognition Based on Multi-scale Feature Maps from Depth Video Sequences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07618.pdf)
>  Human action recognition is an active research area in computer vision. Although great process has been made, previous methods mostly recognize actions based on depth data at only one scale, and thus they often neglect multi-scale features that provide additional information action recognition in practical application scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel framework focusing on multi-scale motion information to recognize human actions from depth video sequences. We propose a multi-scale feature map called Laplacian pyramid depth motion images(LP-DMI). We employ depth motion images (DMI) as the templates to generate the multi-scale static representation of actions. Then, we caculate LP-DMI to enhance multi-scale dynamic information of motions and reduces redundant static information in human bodies. We further extract the multi-granularity descriptor called LP-DMI-HOG to provide more discriminative features. Finally, we utilize extreme learning machine (ELM) for action classification. The proposed method yeilds the recognition accuracy of 93.41%, 85.12%, 91.94% on public MSRAction3D dataset, UTD-MHAD and DHA dataset. Through extensive experiments, we prove that our method outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.      
### 6.Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution with Spectral Mixup and Heterogeneous Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07589.pdf)
>  This work studies Hyperspectral image (HSI) super-resolution (SR). HSI SR is characterized by high-dimensional data and a limited amount of training examples. This exacerbates the undesirable behaviors of neural networks such as memorization and sensitivity to out-of-distribution samples. This work addresses these issues with three contributions. First, we propose a simple, yet effective data augmentation routine, termed Spectral Mixup, to construct effective virtual training samples. Second, we observe that HSI SR and RGB image SR are correlated and develop a novel multi-tasking network to train them jointly so that the auxiliary task RGB image SR can provide additional supervision. Finally, we extend the network to a semi-supervised setting so that it can learn from datasets containing low-resolution HSIs only. With these contributions, our method is able to learn from heterogeneous datasets and lift the requirement for having a large amount of HD HSI training samples. Extensive experiments on four datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods significantly and underpin the relevance of our contributions. The code of this work will be released soon.      
### 7.Collaboration among Image and Object Level Features for Image Colourisation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07576.pdf)
>  Image colourisation is an ill-posed problem, with multiple correct solutions which depend on the context and object instances present in the input datum. Previous approaches attacked the problem either by requiring intense user interactions or by exploiting the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in learning image level (context) features. However, obtaining human hints is not always feasible and CNNs alone are not able to learn object-level semantics unless multiple models pretrained with supervision are considered. In this work, we propose a single network, named UCapsNet, that separate image-level features obtained through convolutions and object-level features captured by means of capsules. Then, by skip connections over different layers, we enforce collaboration between such disentangling factors to produce high quality and plausible image colourisation. We pose the problem as a classification task that can be addressed by a fully self-supervised approach, thus requires no human effort. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms existing methods on standard quality metrics and achieves a state of the art performances on image colourisation. A large scale user study shows that our method is preferred over existing solutions.      
### 8.An Improvement of Object Detection Performance using Multi-step Machine Learnings  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07571.pdf)
>  Connecting multiple machine learning models into a pipeline is effective for handling complex problems. By breaking down the problem into steps, each tackled by a specific component model of the pipeline, the overall solution can be made accurate and explainable. This paper describes an enhancement of object detection based on this multi-step concept, where a post-processing step called the calibration model is introduced. The calibration model consists of a convolutional neural network, and utilizes rich contextual information based on the domain knowledge of the input. Improvements of object detection performance by 0.8-1.9 in average precision metric over existing object detectors have been observed using the new model.      
### 9.JigsawGAN: Self-supervised Learning for Solving Jigsaw Puzzles with Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07555.pdf)
>  The paper proposes a solution based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for solving jigsaw puzzles. The problem assumes that an image is cut into equal square pieces, and asks to recover the image according to pieces information. Conventional jigsaw solvers often determine piece relationships based on the piece boundaries, which ignore the important semantic information. In this paper, we propose JigsawGAN, a GAN-based self-supervised method for solving jigsaw puzzles with unpaired images (with no prior knowledge of the initial images). We design a multi-task pipeline that includes, (1) a classification branch to classify jigsaw permutations, and (2) a GAN branch to recover features to images with correct orders. The classification branch is constrained by the pseudo-labels generated according to the shuffled pieces. The GAN branch concentrates on the image semantic information, among which the generator produces the natural images to fool the discriminator with reassembled pieces, while the discriminator distinguishes whether a given image belongs to the synthesized or the real target manifold. These two branches are connected by a flow-based warp that is applied to warp features to correct order according to the classification results. The proposed method can solve jigsaw puzzles more efficiently by utilizing both semantic information and edge information simultaneously. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons against several leading prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our method.      
### 10.Object Tracking by Detection with Visual and Motion Cues  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07549.pdf)
>  Self-driving cars and other autonomous vehicles need to detect and track objects in camera images. We present a simple online tracking algorithm that is based on a constant velocity motion model with a Kalman filter, and an assignment heuristic. The assignment heuristic relies on four metrics: An embedding vector that describes the appearance of objects and can be used to re-identify them, a displacement vector that describes the object movement between two consecutive video frames, the Mahalanobis distance between the Kalman filter states and the new detections, and a class distance. These metrics are combined with a linear SVM, and then the assignment problem is solved by the Hungarian algorithm. We also propose an efficient CNN architecture that estimates these metrics. Our multi-frame model accepts two consecutive video frames which are processed individually in the backbone, and then optical flow is estimated on the resulting feature maps. This allows the network heads to estimate the displacement vectors. We evaluate our approach on the challenging BDD100K tracking dataset. Our multi-frame model achieves a good MOTA value of 39.1% with low localization error of 0.206 in MOTP. Our fast single-frame model achieves an even lower localization error of 0.202 in MOTP, and a MOTA value of 36.8%.      
### 11.VML-MOC: Segmenting a multiply oriented and curved handwritten text lines dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07542.pdf)
>  This paper publishes a natural and very complicated dataset of handwritten documents with multiply oriented and curved text lines, namely VML-MOC dataset. These text lines were written as remarks on the page margins by different writers over the years. They appear at different locations within the orientations that range between 0 and 180 or as curvilinear forms. We evaluate a multi-oriented Gaussian based method to segment these handwritten text lines that are skewed or curved in any orientation. It achieves a mean pixel Intersection over Union score of 80.96% on the test documents. The results are compared with the results of a single-oriented Gaussian based text line segmentation method.      
### 12.PICA: A Pixel Correlation-based Attentional Black-box Adversarial Attack  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07538.pdf)
>  The studies on black-box adversarial attacks have become increasingly prevalent due to the intractable acquisition of the structural knowledge of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the performance of emerging attacks is negatively impacted when fooling DNNs tailored for high-resolution images. One of the explanations is that these methods usually focus on attacking the entire image, regardless of its spatial semantic information, and thereby encounter the notorious curse of dimensionality. To this end, we propose a pixel correlation-based attentional black-box adversarial attack, termed as PICA. Firstly, we take only one of every two neighboring pixels in the salient region as the target by leveraging the attentional mechanism and pixel correlation of images, such that the dimension of the black-box attack reduces. After that, a general multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is employed to traverse the reduced pixels and generate perturbations that are imperceptible by the human vision. Extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed PICA on the ImageNet dataset. More importantly, PICA is computationally more efficient to generate high-resolution adversarial examples compared with the existing black-box attacks.      
### 13.Intelligent Frame Selection as a Privacy-Friendlier Alternative to Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07529.pdf)
>  The widespread deployment of surveillance cameras for facial recognition gives rise to many privacy concerns. This study proposes a privacy-friendly alternative to large scale facial recognition. While there are multiple techniques to preserve privacy, our work is based on the minimization principle which implies minimizing the amount of collected personal data. Instead of running facial recognition software on all video data, we propose to automatically extract a high quality snapshot of each detected person without revealing his or her identity. This snapshot is then encrypted and access is only granted after legal authorization. We introduce a novel unsupervised face image quality assessment method which is used to select the high quality snapshots. For this, we train a variational autoencoder on high quality face images from a publicly available dataset and use the reconstruction probability as a metric to estimate the quality of each face crop. We experimentally confirm that the reconstruction probability can be used as biometric quality predictor. Unlike most previous studies, we do not rely on a manually defined face quality metric as everything is learned from data. Our face quality assessment method outperforms supervised, unsupervised and general image quality assessment methods on the task of improving face verification performance by rejecting low quality images. The effectiveness of the whole system is validated qualitatively on still images and videos.      
### 14.The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Patches in Deep Convolutional Kernels Methods  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07528.pdf)
>  A recent line of work showed that various forms of convolutional kernel methods can be competitive with standard supervised deep convolutional networks on datasets like CIFAR-10, obtaining accuracies in the range of 87-90% while being more amenable to theoretical analysis. In this work, we highlight the importance of a data-dependent feature extraction step that is key to the obtain good performance in convolutional kernel methods. This step typically corresponds to a whitened dictionary of patches, and gives rise to a data-driven convolutional kernel methods. We extensively study its effect, demonstrating it is the key ingredient for high performance of these methods. Specifically, we show that one of the simplest instances of such kernel methods, based on a single layer of image patches followed by a linear classifier is already obtaining classification accuracies on CIFAR-10 in the same range as previous more sophisticated convolutional kernel methods. We scale this method to the challenging ImageNet dataset, showing such a simple approach can exceed all existing non-learned representation methods. This is a new baseline for object recognition without representation learning methods, that initiates the investigation of convolutional kernel models on ImageNet. We conduct experiments to analyze the dictionary that we used, our ablations showing they exhibit low-dimensional properties.      
### 15.BANet: Blur-aware Attention Networks for Dynamic Scene Deblurring  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07518.pdf)
>  Image motion blur usually results from moving objects or camera shakes. Such blur is generally directional and non-uniform. Previous research efforts attempt to solve non-uniform blur by using self-recurrent multi-scale or multi-patch architectures accompanying with self-attention. However, using self-recurrent frameworks typically leads to a longer inference time, while inter-pixel or inter-channel self-attention may cause excessive memory usage. This paper proposes blur-aware attention networks (BANet) that accomplish accurate and efficient deblurring via a single forward pass. Our BANet utilizes region-based self-attention with multi-kernel strip pooling to disentangle blur patterns of different degrees and with cascaded parallel dilated convolution to aggregate multi-scale content features. Extensive experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BANet performs favorably against the state-of-the-art in blurred image restoration and can provide deblurred results in realtime.      
### 16.Attention-Guided Black-box Adversarial Attacks with Large-Scale Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07512.pdf)
>  Fooling deep neural networks (DNNs) with the black-box optimization has become a popular adversarial attack fashion, as the structural prior knowledge of DNNs is always unknown. Nevertheless, recent black-box adversarial attacks may struggle to balance their attack ability and visual quality of the generated adversarial examples (AEs) in tackling high-resolution images. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided black-box adversarial attack based on the large-scale multiobjective evolutionary optimization, termed as LMOA. By considering the spatial semantic information of images, we firstly take advantage of the attention map to determine the perturbed pixels. Instead of attacking the entire image, reducing the perturbed pixels with the attention mechanism can help to avoid the notorious curse of dimensionality and thereby improves the performance of attacking. Secondly, a large-scale multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is employed to traverse the reduced pixels in the salient region. Benefiting from its characteristics, the generated AEs have the potential to fool target DNNs while being imperceptible by the human vision. Extensive experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed LMOA on the ImageNet dataset. More importantly, it is more competitive to generate high-resolution AEs with better visual quality compared with the existing black-box adversarial attacks.      
### 17.Unsupervised Deep Learning for Handwritten Page Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07487.pdf)
>  Segmenting handwritten document images into regions with homogeneous patterns is an important pre-processing step for many document images analysis tasks. Hand-labeling data to train a deep learning model for layout analysis requires significant human effort. In this paper, we present an unsupervised deep learning method for page segmentation, which revokes the need for annotated images. A siamese neural network is trained to differentiate between patches using their measurable properties such as number of foreground pixels, and average component height and width. The network is trained that spatially nearby patches are similar. The network's learned features are used for page segmentation, where patches are classified as main and side text based on the extracted features. We tested the method on a dataset of handwritten document images with quite complex layouts. Our experiments show that the proposed unsupervised method is as effective as typical supervised methods.      
### 18.Deep Reinforcement Learning for Producing Furniture Layout in Indoor Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07462.pdf)
>  In the industrial interior design process, professional designers plan the size and position of furniture in a room to achieve a satisfactory design for selling. In this paper, we explore the interior scene design task as a Markov decision process (MDP), which is solved by deep reinforcement learning. The goal is to produce an accurate position and size of the furniture simultaneously for the indoor layout task. In particular, we first formulate the furniture layout task as a MDP problem by defining the state, action, and reward function. We then design the simulated environment and train reinforcement learning agents to produce the optimal layout for the MDP formulation. We conduct our experiments on a large-scale real-world interior layout dataset that contains industrial designs from professional designers. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model yields higher-quality layouts as compared with the state-of-art model. The developed simulator and codes are available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/CODE-SUBMIT/simulator1" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 19.Hybrid Trilinear and Bilinear Programming for Aligning Partially Overlapping Point Sets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07458.pdf)
>  Alignment methods which can handle partially overlapping point sets and are invariant to the corresponding transformations are desirable in computer vision, with applications such as providing initial transformation configuration for local search based methods like ICP. To this end, we first show that the objective of the robust point matching (RPM) algorithm is a cubic polynomial. We then utilize the convex envelopes of trilinear and bilinear monomials to develop its lower bounding function. The resulting lower bounding problem can be efficiently solved via linear assignment and low dimensional convex quadratic programming. We next develop a branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm which only branches over the transformation parameters and converges quickly. Experimental results demonstrated favorable performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and speed.      
### 20.Fast Convergence of DETR with Spatially Modulated Co-Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07448.pdf)
>  The recently proposed Detection Transformer (DETR) model successfully applies Transformer to objects detection and achieves comparable performance with two-stage object detection frameworks, such as Faster-RCNN. However, DETR suffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR \cite{carion2020end} from scratch needs 500 epochs to achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple yet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially Modulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct regression-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to be high near initially estimated bounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA increases DETR's convergence speed by replacing the original co-attention mechanism in the decoder while keeping other operations in DETR unchanged. Furthermore, by integrating multi-head and scale-selection attention designs into SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve better performance compared to DETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone (45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3 mAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive ablation studies on COCO dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMCA.      
### 21.CAA : Channelized Axial Attention for Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07434.pdf)
>  Self-attention and channel attention, modelling the semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively, have recently been widely used for semantic segmentation. However, computing self-attention and channel attention separately and then fusing them directly can cause conflicting feature representations. In this paper, we propose the Channelized Axial Attention (CAA) to seamlessly integrate channel attention and axial attention with reduced computational complexity. After computing axial attention maps, we propose to channelize the intermediate results obtained from the transposed dot-product so that the channel importance of each axial representation is optimized across the whole receptive field. We further develop grouped vectorization, which allows our model to be run in the very limited GPU memory with a speed comparable with full vectorization. Comparative experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that our CAA not only requires much less computation resources but also outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation models based on ResNet-101 on all tested datasets.      
### 22.SOSD-Net: Joint Semantic Object Segmentation and Depth Estimation from Monocular images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07422.pdf)
>  Depth estimation and semantic segmentation play essential roles in scene understanding. The state-of-the-art methods employ multi-task learning to simultaneously learn models for these two tasks at the pixel-wise level. They usually focus on sharing the common features or stitching feature maps from the corresponding branches. However, these methods lack in-depth consideration on the correlation of the geometric cues and the scene parsing. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of semantic objectness to exploit the geometric relationship of these two tasks through an analysis of the imaging process, then propose a Semantic Object Segmentation and Depth Estimation Network (SOSD-Net) based on the objectness assumption. To the best of our knowledge, SOSD-Net is the first network that exploits the geometry constraint for simultaneous monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation. In addition, considering the mutual implicit relationship between these two tasks, we exploit the iterative idea from the expectation-maximization algorithm to train the proposed network more effectively. Extensive experimental results on the Cityscapes and NYU v2 dataset are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.      
### 23.GIID-Net: Generalizable Image Inpainting Detection via Neural Architecture Search and Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07419.pdf)
>  Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated its powerful capabilities in the field of image inpainting, which could produce visually plausible results. Meanwhile, the malicious use of advanced image inpainting tools (e.g. removing key objects to report fake news) has led to increasing threats to the reliability of image data. To fight against the inpainting forgeries, in this work, we propose a novel end-to-end Generalizable Image Inpainting Detection Network (GIID-Net), to detect the inpainted regions at pixel accuracy. The proposed GIID-Net consists of three sub-blocks: the enhancement block, the extraction block and the decision block. Specifically, the enhancement block aims to enhance the inpainting traces by using hierarchically combined special layers. The extraction block, automatically designed by Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm, is targeted to extract features for the actual inpainting detection tasks. In order to further optimize the extracted latent features, we integrate global and local attention modules in the decision block, where the global attention reduces the intra-class differences by measuring the similarity of global features, while the local attention strengthens the consistency of local features. Furthermore, we thoroughly study the generalizability of our GIID-Net, and find that different training data could result in vastly different generalization capability. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the superiority of the proposed GIID-Net, compared with the state-of-the-art competitors. Our results would suggest that common artifacts are shared across diverse image inpainting methods. Finally, we build a public inpainting dataset of 10K image pairs for the future research in this area.      
### 24.Initialization Using Perlin Noise for Training Networks with a Limited Amount of Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07406.pdf)
>  We propose a novel network initialization method using Perlin noise for training image classification networks with a limited amount of data. Our main idea is to initialize the network parameters by solving an artificial noise classification problem, where the aim is to classify Perlin noise samples into their noise categories. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two steps. First, it generates Perlin noise samples with category labels defined based on noise complexity. Second, it solves a classification problem, in which network parameters are optimized to classify the generated noise samples. This method produces a reasonable set of initial weights (filters) for image classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to initialize networks by solving an artificial optimization problem without using any real-world images. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms conventional initialization methods on four image classification datasets.      
### 25.ArtEmis: Affective Language for Visual Art  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07396.pdf)
>  We present a novel large-scale dataset and accompanying machine learning models aimed at providing a detailed understanding of the interplay between visual content, its emotional effect, and explanations for the latter in language. In contrast to most existing annotation datasets in computer vision, we focus on the affective experience triggered by visual artworks and ask the annotators to indicate the dominant emotion they feel for a given image and, crucially, to also provide a grounded verbal explanation for their emotion choice. As we demonstrate below, this leads to a rich set of signals for both the objective content and the affective impact of an image, creating associations with abstract concepts (e.g., "freedom" or "love"), or references that go beyond what is directly visible, including visual similes and metaphors, or subjective references to personal experiences. We focus on visual art (e.g., paintings, artistic photographs) as it is a prime example of imagery created to elicit emotional responses from its viewers. Our dataset, termed ArtEmis, contains 439K emotion attributions and explanations from humans, on 81K artworks from WikiArt. Building on this data, we train and demonstrate a series of captioning systems capable of expressing and explaining emotions from visual stimuli. Remarkably, the captions produced by these systems often succeed in reflecting the semantic and abstract content of the image, going well beyond systems trained on existing datasets. The collected dataset and developed methods are available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://artemisdataset.org" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 26.Galaxy Image Translation with Semi-supervised Noise-reconstructed Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07389.pdf)
>  Image-to-image translation with Deep Learning neural networks, particularly with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), is one of the most powerful methods for simulating astronomical images. However, current work is limited to utilizing paired images with supervised translation, and there has been rare discussion on reconstructing noise background that encodes instrumental and observational effects. These limitations might be harmful for subsequent scientific applications in astrophysics. Therefore, we aim to develop methods for using unpaired images and preserving noise characteristics in image translation. In this work, we propose a two-way image translation model using GANs that exploits both paired and unpaired images in a semi-supervised manner, and introduce a noise emulating module that is able to learn and reconstruct noise characterized by high-frequency features. By experimenting on multi-band galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHT), we show that our method recovers global and local properties effectively and outperforms benchmark image translation models. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to apply semi-supervised methods and noise reconstruction techniques in astrophysical studies.      
### 27.A DCNN-based Arbitrarily-Oriented Object Detector for Quality Control and Inspection Application  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07383.pdf)
>  Following the success of machine vision systems for on-line automated quality control and inspection processes, an object recognition solution is presented in this work for two different specific applications, i.e., the detection of quality control items in surgery toolboxes prepared for sterilizing in a hospital, as well as the detection of defects in vessel hulls to prevent potential structural failures. The solution has two stages. First, a feature pyramid architecture based on Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is used to improve the detection performance, and a statistical analysis based on ground truth is employed to select parameters of a range of default boxes. Second, a lightweight neural network is exploited to achieve oriented detection results using a regression method. The first stage of the proposed method is capable of detecting the small targets considered in the two scenarios. In the second stage, despite the simplicity, it is efficient to detect elongated targets while maintaining high running efficiency.      
### 28.Text line extraction using fully convolutional network and energy minimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07370.pdf)
>  Text lines are important parts of handwritten document images and easier to analyze by further applications. Despite recent progress in text line detection, text line extraction from a handwritten document remains an unsolved task. This paper proposes to use a fully convolutional network for text line detection and energy minimization for text line extraction. Detected text lines are represented by blob lines that strike through the text lines. These blob lines assist an energy function for text line extraction. The detection stage can locate arbitrarily oriented text lines. Furthermore, the extraction stage is capable of finding out the pixels of text lines with various heights and interline proximity independent of their orientations. Besides, it can finely split the touching and overlapping text lines without an orientation assumption. We evaluate the proposed method on VML-AHTE, VML-MOC, and Diva-HisDB datasets. The VML-AHTE dataset contains overlapping, touching and close text lines with rich diacritics. The VML-MOC dataset is very challenging by its multiply oriented and skewed text lines. The Diva-HisDB dataset exhibits distinct text line heights and touching text lines. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method despite various types of challenges, yet using the same parameters in all the experiments.      
### 29.Improving Makeup Face Verification by Exploring Part-Based Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07338.pdf)
>  Recently, we have seen an increase in the global facial recognition market size. Despite significant advances in face recognition technology with the adoption of convolutional neural networks, there are still open challenges, as when there is makeup in the face. To address this challenge, we propose and evaluate the adoption of facial parts to fuse with current holistic representations. We propose two strategies of facial parts: one with four regions (left periocular, right periocular, nose and mouth) and another with three facial thirds (upper, middle and lower). Experimental results obtained in four public makeup face datasets and in a challenging cross-dataset protocol show that the fusion of deep features extracted of facial parts with holistic representation increases the accuracy of face verification systems and decreases the error rates, even without any retraining of the CNN models. Our proposed pipeline achieved state-of-the-art performance for the YMU dataset and competitive results for other three datasets (EMFD, FAM and M501).      
### 30.Knowledge Distillation Methods for Efficient Unsupervised Adaptation Across Multiple Domains  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07308.pdf)
>  Beyond the complexity of CNNs that require training on large annotated datasets, the domain shift between design and operational data has limited the adoption of CNNs in many real-world applications. For instance, in person re-identification, videos are captured over a distributed set of cameras with non-overlapping viewpoints. The shift between the source (e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. cameras) domains may lead to a significant decline in recognition accuracy. Additionally, state-of-the-art CNNs may not be suitable for such real-time applications given their computational requirements. Although several techniques have recently been proposed to address domain shift problems through unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), or to accelerate/compress CNNs through knowledge distillation (KD), we seek to simultaneously adapt and compress CNNs to generalize well across multiple target domains. In this paper, we propose a progressive KD approach for unsupervised single-target DA (STDA) and multi-target DA (MTDA) of CNNs. Our method for KD-STDA adapts a CNN to a single target domain by distilling from a larger teacher CNN, trained on both target and source domain data in order to maintain its consistency with a common representation. Our proposed approach is compared against state-of-the-art methods for compression and STDA of CNNs on the Office31 and ImageClef-DA image classification datasets. It is also compared against state-of-the-art methods for MTDA on Digits, Office31, and OfficeHome. In both settings -- KD-STDA and KD-MTDA -- results indicate that our approach can achieve the highest level of accuracy across target domains, while requiring a comparable or lower CNN complexity.      
### 31.Diagnostic Captioning: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07299.pdf)
>  Diagnostic Captioning (DC) concerns the automatic generation of a diagnostic text from a set of medical images of a patient collected during an examination. DC can assist inexperienced physicians, reducing clinical errors. It can also help experienced physicians produce diagnostic reports faster. Following the advances of deep learning, especially in generic image captioning, DC has recently attracted more attention, leading to several systems and datasets. This article is an extensive overview of DC. It presents relevant datasets, evaluation measures, and up to date systems. It also highlights shortcomings that hinder DC's progress and proposes future directions.      
### 32.Using Shape to Categorize: Low-Shot Learning with an Explicit Shape Bias  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07296.pdf)
>  It is widely accepted that reasoning about object shape is important for object recognition. However, the most powerful object recognition methods today do not explicitly make use of object shape during learning. In this work, motivated by recent developments in low-shot learning, findings in developmental psychology, and the increased use of synthetic data in computer vision research, we investigate how reasoning about 3D shape can be used to improve low-shot learning methods' generalization performance. We propose a new way to improve existing low-shot learning approaches by learning a discriminative embedding space using 3D object shape, and utilizing this embedding by learning how to map images into it. Our new approach improves the performance of image-only low-shot learning approaches on multiple datasets. We also develop Toys4K, a new 3D object dataset with the biggest number of object categories that can also support low-shot learning.      
### 33.Magnification Generalization for Histopathology Image Embedding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07757.pdf)
>  Histopathology image embedding is an active research area in computer vision. Most of the embedding models exclusively concentrate on a specific magnification level. However, a useful task in histopathology embedding is to train an embedding space regardless of the magnification level. Two main approaches for tackling this goal are domain adaptation and domain generalization, where the target magnification levels may or may not be introduced to the model in training, respectively. Although magnification adaptation is a well-studied topic in the literature, this paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work on magnification generalization for histopathology image embedding. We use an episodic trainable domain generalization technique for magnification generalization, namely Model Agnostic Learning of Semantic Features (MASF), which works based on the Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) concept. Our experimental results on a breast cancer histopathology dataset with four different magnification levels show the proposed method's effectiveness for magnification generalization.      
### 34.Quantum Permutation Synchronization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07755.pdf)
>  We present QuantumSync, the first quantum algorithm for solving a synchronization problem in the context of computer vision. In particular, we focus on permutation synchronization which involves solving a non-convex optimization problem in discrete variables. We start by formulating synchronization into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO). While such formulation respects the binary nature of the problem, ensuring that the result is a set of permutations requires extra care. Hence, we: (i) show how to insert permutation constraints into a QUBO problem and (ii) solve the constrained QUBO problem on the current generation of the adiabatic quantum computers D-Wave. Thanks to the quantum annealing, we guarantee global optimality with high probability while sampling the energy landscape to yield confidence estimates. Our proof-of-concepts realization on the adiabatic D-Wave computer demonstrates that quantum machines offer a promising way to solve the prevalent yet difficult synchronization problems.      
### 35.A survey on shape-constraint deep learning for medical image segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07721.pdf)
>  Since the advent of U-Net, fully convolutional deep neural networks and its many variants have completely changed the modern landscape of deep learning based medical image segmentation. However, the over dependence of these methods on pixel level classification and regression has been identified early on as a problem. Especially when trained on medical databases with sparse available annotation, these methods are prone to generate segmentation artifacts such as fragmented structures, topological inconsistencies and islands of pixel. These artefacts are especially problematic in medical imaging since segmentation is almost always a pre-processing step for some downstream evaluation. The range of possible downstream evaluations is rather big, for example surgical planning, visualization, shape analysis, prognosis, treatment planning etc. However, one common thread across all these downstream tasks is the demand of anatomical consistency. To ensure the segmentation result is anatomically consistent, approaches based on Markov/ Conditional Random Fields, Statistical Shape Models are becoming increasingly popular over the past 5 years. In this review paper, a broad overview of recent literature on bringing anatomical constraints for medical image segmentation is given, the shortcomings and opportunities of the proposed methods are thoroughly discussed and potential future work is elaborated. We review the most relevant papers published until the submission date. For quick access, important details such as the underlying method, datasets and performance are tabulated.      
### 36.Predicting Pneumonia and Region Detection from X-Ray Images using Deep Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07717.pdf)
>  Biomedical images are increasing drastically. Along the way, many machine learning algorithms have been proposed to predict and identify various kinds of diseases. One such disease is Pneumonia which is an infection caused by both bacteria and viruses through the inflammation of a person's lung air sacs. In this paper, an algorithm was proposed that receives x-ray images as input and verifies whether this patient is infected by Pneumonia as well as specific region of the lungs that the inflammation has occurred at. The algorithm is based on the transfer learning mechanism where pre-trained ResNet-50 (Convolutional Neural Network) was used followed by some custom layer for making the prediction. The model has achieved an accuracy of 90.6 percent which confirms that the model is effective and can be implemented for the detection of Pneumonia in patients. Furthermore, a class activation map is used for the detection of the infected region in the lungs. Also, PneuNet was developed so that users can access more easily and use the services.      
### 37.Meningioma segmentation in T1-weighted MRI leveraging global context and attention mechanisms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07715.pdf)
>  Meningiomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor, accounting for approximately 30% of all brain tumors. A substantial number of these tumors are never surgically removed but rather monitored over time. Automatic and precise meningioma segmentation is therefore beneficial to enable reliable growth estimation and patient-specific treatment planning. In this study, we propose the inclusion of attention mechanisms over a U-Net architecture: (i) Attention-gated U-Net (AGUNet) and (ii) Dual Attention U-Net (DAUNet), using a 3D MRI volume as input. Attention has the potential to leverage the global context and identify features' relationships across the entire volume. To limit spatial resolution degradation and loss of detail inherent to encoder-decoder architectures, we studied the impact of multi-scale input and deep supervision components. The proposed architectures are trainable end-to-end and each concept can be seamlessly disabled for ablation studies. The validation studies were performed using a 5-fold cross validation over 600 T1-weighted MRI volumes from St. Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. For the best performing architecture, an average Dice score of 81.6% was reached for an F1-score of 95.6%. With an almost perfect precision of 98%, meningiomas smaller than 3ml were occasionally missed hence reaching an overall recall of 93%. Leveraging global context from a 3D MRI volume provided the best performances, even if the native volume resolution could not be processed directly. Overall, near-perfect detection was achieved for meningiomas larger than 3ml which is relevant for clinical use. In the future, the use of multi-scale designs and refinement networks should be further investigated to improve the performance. A larger number of cases with meningiomas below 3ml might also be needed to improve the performance for the smallest tumors.      
### 38.Multi-target detection with rotations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07709.pdf)
>  We consider the multi-target detection problem of estimating a two-dimensional target image from a large noisy measurement image that contains many randomly rotated and translated copies of the target image. Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we focus on the low signal-to-noise regime, where it is difficult to estimate the locations and orientations of the target images in the measurement. Our approach uses autocorrelation analysis to estimate rotationally and translationally invariant features of the target image. We demonstrate that, regardless of the level of noise, our technique can be used to recover the target image when the measurement is sufficiently large.      
### 39.Improve Global Glomerulosclerosis Classification with Imbalanced Data using CircleMix Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07654.pdf)
>  The classification of glomerular lesions is a routine and essential task in renal pathology. Recently, machine learning approaches, especially deep learning algorithms, have been used to perform computer-aided lesion characterization of glomeruli. However, one major challenge of developing such methods is the naturally imbalanced distribution of different lesions. In this paper, we propose CircleMix, a novel data augmentation technique, to improve the accuracy of classifying globally sclerotic glomeruli with a hierarchical learning strategy. Different from the recently proposed CutMix method, the CircleMix augmentation is optimized for the ball-shaped biomedical objects, such as glomeruli. 6,861 glomeruli with five classes (normal, periglomerular fibrosis, obsolescent glomerulosclerosis, solidified glomerulosclerosis, and disappearing glomerulosclerosis) were employed to develop and evaluate the proposed methods. From five-fold cross-validation, the proposed CircleMix augmentation achieved superior performance (Balanced Accuracy=73.0%) compared with the EfficientNet-B0 baseline (Balanced Accuracy=69.4%)      
### 40.Unsupervised Domain Adaptation from Axial toShort-Axis Multi-Slice Cardiac MR Images byIncorporating Pretrained Task Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07653.pdf)
>  Anisotropic multi-slice Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Images are conventionally acquired in patient-specific short-axis (SAX) orientation. In specific cardiovascular diseases that affect right ventricular (RV) morphology, acquisitions in standard axial (AX) orientation are preferred by some investigators, due to potential superiority in RV volume measurement for treatment planning. Unfortunately, due to the rare occurrence of these diseases, data in this domain is scarce. Recent research in deep learning-based methods mainly focused on SAX CMR images and they had proven to be very successful. In this work, we show that there is a considerable domain shift between AX and SAX images, and therefore, direct application of existing models yield sub-optimal results on AX samples. We propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation approach, which uses task-related probabilities in an attention mechanism. Beyond that, cycle consistency is imposed on the learned patient-individual 3D rigid transformation to improve stability when automatically re-sampling the AX images to SAX orientations. The network was trained on 122 registered 3D AX-SAX CMR volume pairs from a multi-centric patient cohort. A mean 3D Dice of $0.86\pm{0.06}$ for the left ventricle, $0.65\pm{0.08}$ for the myocardium, and $0.77\pm{0.10}$ for the right ventricle could be achieved. This is an improvement of $25\%$ in Dice for RV in comparison to direct application on axial slices. To conclude, our pre-trained task module has neither seen CMR images nor labels from the target domain, but is able to segment them after the domain gap is reduced.

### 41.A Lightweight Structure Aimed to Utilize Spatial Correlation for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07613.pdf)
>  Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is known as a widely used approach to reduce radiation dose while accelerating imaging through lowered projection views and correlated calculations. However, its severe imaging noise and streaking artifacts turn out to be a major issue in the low dose protocol. In this paper, we propose a dual-domain deep learning-based method that breaks through the limitations of currently prevailing algorithms that merely process single image slices. Since the scanned object usually contains a high degree of spatial continuity, the obtained consecutive imaging slices embody rich information that is largely unexplored. Therefore, we establish a cascade model named LS-AAE which aims to tackle the above problem. In addition, in order to adapt to the social trend of lightweight medical care, our model adopts the inverted residual with linear bottleneck in the module design to make it mobile and lightweight (reduce model parameters to one-eighth of its original) without sacrificing its performance. In our experiments, sparse sampling is conducted at intervals of 4°, 8° and 16°, which appears to be a challenging sparsity that few scholars have attempted before. Nevertheless, our method still exhibits its robustness and achieves the state-of-the-art performance by reaching the PSNR of 40.305 and the SSIM of 0.948, while ensuring high model mobility. Particularly, it still exceeds other current methods when the sampling rate is one-fourth of them, thereby demonstrating its remarkable superiority.      
### 42.Comparative Evaluation of 3D and 2D Deep Learning Techniques for Semantic Segmentation in CT Scans  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07612.pdf)
>  Image segmentation plays a pivotal role in several medical-imaging applications by assisting the segmentation of the regions of interest. Deep learning-based approaches have been widely adopted for semantic segmentation of medical data. In recent years, in addition to 2D deep learning architectures, 3D architectures have been employed as the predictive algorithms for 3D medical image data. In this paper, we propose a 3D stack-based deep learning technique for segmenting manifestations of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in 3D Computed Tomography (CT) scans. We also present a comparison based on the segmentation results, the contextual information retained, and the inference time between this 3D technique and a traditional 2D deep learning technique. We also define the area-plot, which represents the peculiar pattern observed in the slice-wise areas of the pathology regions predicted by these deep learning models. In our exhaustive evaluation, 3D technique performs better than the 2D technique for the segmentation of CT scans. We get dice scores of 79% and 73% for the 3D and the 2D techniques respectively. The 3D technique results in a 5X reduction in the inference time compared to the 2D technique. Results also show that the area-plots predicted by the 3D model are more similar to the ground truth than those predicted by the 2D model. We also show how increasing the amount of contextual information retained during the training can improve the 3D model's performance.      
### 43.Deep Learning Models for Calculation of Cardiothoracic Ratio from Chest Radiographs for Assisted Diagnosis of Cardiomegaly  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07606.pdf)
>  We propose an automated method based on deep learning to compute the cardiothoracic ratio and detect the presence of cardiomegaly from chest radiographs. We develop two separate models to demarcate the heart and chest regions in an X-ray image using bounding boxes and use their outputs to calculate the cardiothoracic ratio. We obtain a sensitivity of 0.96 at a specificity of 0.81 with a mean absolute error of 0.0209 on a held-out test dataset and a sensitivity of 0.84 at a specificity of 0.97 with a mean absolute error of 0.018 on an independent dataset from a different hospital. We also compare three different segmentation model architectures for the proposed method and observe that Attention U-Net yields better results than SE-Resnext U-Net and EfficientNet U-Net. By providing a numeric measurement of the cardiothoracic ratio, we hope to mitigate human subjectivity arising out of visual assessment in the detection of cardiomegaly.      
### 44.Real-Time Limited-View CT Inpainting and Reconstruction with Dual Domain Based on Spatial Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07594.pdf)
>  Low-dose Computed Tomography is a common issue in reality. Current reduction, sparse sampling and limited-view scanning can all cause it. Between them, limited-view CT is general in the industry due to inevitable mechanical and physical limitation. However, limited-view CT can cause serious imaging problem on account of its massive information loss. Thus, we should effectively utilize the scant prior information to perform completion. It is an undeniable fact that CT imaging slices are extremely dense, which leads to high continuity between successive images. We realized that fully exploit the spatial correlation between consecutive frames can significantly improve restoration results in video inpainting. Inspired by this, we propose a deep learning-based three-stage algorithm that hoist limited-view CT imaging quality based on spatial information. In stage one, to better utilize prior information in the Radon domain, we design an adversarial autoencoder to complement the Radon data. In the second stage, a model is built to perform inpainting based on spatial continuity in the image domain. At this point, we have roughly restored the imaging, while its texture still needs to be finely repaired. Hence, we propose a model to accurately restore the image in stage three, and finally achieve an ideal inpainting result. In addition, we adopt FBP instead of SART-TV to make our algorithm more suitable for real-time use. In the experiment, we restore and reconstruct the Radon data that has been cut the rear one-third part, they achieve PSNR of 40.209, SSIM of 0.943, while precisely present the texture.      
### 45.Using StyleGAN for Visual Interpretability of Deep Learning Models on Medical Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07563.pdf)
>  As AI-based medical devices are becoming more common in imaging fields like radiology and histology, interpretability of the underlying predictive models is crucial to expand their use in clinical practice. Existing heatmap-based interpretability methods such as GradCAM only highlight the location of predictive features but do not explain how they contribute to the prediction. In this paper, we propose a new interpretability method that can be used to understand the predictions of any black-box model on images, by showing how the input image would be modified in order to produce different predictions. A StyleGAN is trained on medical images to provide a mapping between latent vectors and images. Our method identifies the optimal direction in the latent space to create a change in the model prediction. By shifting the latent representation of an input image along this direction, we can produce a series of new synthetic images with changed predictions. We validate our approach on histology and radiology images, and demonstrate its ability to provide meaningful explanations that are more informative than GradCAM heatmaps. Our method reveals the patterns learned by the model, which allows clinicians to build trust in the model's predictions, discover new biomarkers and eventually reveal potential biases.      
### 46.Momentum^2 Teacher: Momentum Teacher with Momentum Statistics for Self-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07525.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a novel approach, Momentum$^2$ Teacher, for student-teacher based self-supervised learning. The approach performs momentum update on both network weights and batch normalization (BN) statistics. The teacher's weight is a momentum update of the student, and the teacher's BN statistics is a momentum update of those in history. The Momentum$^2$ Teacher is simple and efficient. It can achieve the state of the art results (74.5\%) under ImageNet linear evaluation protocol using small-batch size(\eg, 128), without requiring large-batch training on special hardware like TPU or inefficient across GPU operation (\eg, shuffling BN, synced BN). Our implementation and pre-trained models will be given on GitHub\footnote{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/zengarden/momentum2-teacher" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 47.COVID-Net CT-2: Enhanced Deep Neural Networks for Detection of COVID-19 from Chest CT Images Through Bigger, More Diverse Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07433.pdf)
>  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on, with multiple waves causing substantial harm to health and economies around the world. Motivated by the use of CT imaging at clinical institutes around the world as an effective complementary screening method to RT-PCR testing, we introduced COVID-Net CT, a neural network tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images as part of the open source COVID-Net initiative. However, one potential limiting factor is restricted quantity and diversity given the single nation patient cohort used. In this study, we introduce COVID-Net CT-2, enhanced deep neural networks for COVID-19 detection from chest CT images trained on the largest quantity and diversity of multinational patient cases in research literature. We introduce two new CT benchmark datasets, the largest comprising a multinational cohort of 4,501 patients from at least 15 countries. We leverage explainability to investigate the decision-making behaviour of COVID-Net CT-2, with the results for select cases reviewed and reported on by two board-certified radiologists with over 10 and 30 years of experience, respectively. The COVID-Net CT-2 neural networks achieved accuracy, COVID-19 sensitivity, and COVID-19 positive predictive value of 98.1%/96.2%/96.7% and 97.9%/95.7%/96.4%, respectively. Explainability-driven performance validation shows that COVID-Net CT-2's decision-making behaviour is consistent with radiologist interpretation by leveraging correct, clinically relevant critical factors. The results are promising and suggest the strong potential of deep neural networks as an effective tool for computer-aided COVID-19 assessment. While not a production-ready solution, we hope the open-source, open-access release of COVID-Net CT-2 and benchmark datasets will continue to enable researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to build upon them.      
### 48.Learning Efficient, Explainable and Discriminative Representations for Pulmonary Nodules Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07429.pdf)
>  Automatic pulmonary nodules classification is significant for early diagnosis of lung cancers. Recently, deep learning techniques have enabled remarkable progress in this field. However, these deep models are typically of high computational complexity and work in a black-box manner. To combat these challenges, in this work, we aim to build an efficient and (partially) explainable classification model. Specially, we use \emph{neural architecture search} (NAS) to automatically search 3D network architectures with excellent accuracy/speed trade-off. Besides, we use the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) in the networks, which helps us understand the reasoning process. During training, we use A-Softmax loss to learn angularly discriminative representations. In the inference stage, we employ an ensemble of diverse neural networks to improve the prediction accuracy and robustness. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIDC-IDRI database. Compared with previous state-of-the-art, our model shows highly comparable performance by using less than 1/40 parameters. Besides, empirical study shows that the reasoning process of learned networks is in conformity with physicians' diagnosis.

### 49.Deep-Learning Driven Noise Reduction for Reduced Flux Computed Tomography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07376.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have received considerable attention in clinical imaging, particularly with respect to the reduction of radiation risk. Lowering the radiation dose by reducing the photon flux inevitably results in the degradation of the scanned image quality. Thus, researchers have sought to exploit deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to map low-quality, low-dose images to higher-dose, higher-quality images thereby minimizing the associated radiation hazard. Conversely, computed tomography (CT) measurements of geomaterials are not limited by the radiation dose. In contrast to the human body, however, geomaterials may be comprised of high-density constituents causing increased attenuation of the X-Rays. Consequently, higher dosage images are required to obtain an acceptable scan quality. The problem of prolonged acquisition times is particularly severe for micro-CT based scanning technologies. Depending on the sample size and exposure time settings, a single scan may require several hours to complete. This is of particular concern if phenomena with an exponential temperature dependency are to be elucidated. A process may happen too fast to be adequately captured by CT scanning. To address the aforementioned issues, we apply DCNNs to improve the quality of rock CT images and reduce exposure times by more than 60\%, simultaneously. We highlight current results based on micro-CT derived datasets and apply transfer learning to improve DCNN results without increasing training time. The approach is applicable to any computed tomography technology. Furthermore, we contrast the performance of the DCNN trained by minimizing different loss functions such as mean squared error and structural similarity index.      
### 50.Object Detection and Pose Estimation from RGB and Depth Data for Real-time, Adaptive Robotic Grasping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07347.pdf)
>  In recent times, object detection and pose estimation have gained significant attention in the context of robotic vision applications. Both the identification of objects of interest as well as the estimation of their pose remain important capabilities in order for robots to provide effective assistance for numerous robotic applications ranging from household tasks to industrial manipulation. This problem is particularly challenging because of the heterogeneity of objects having different and potentially complex shapes, and the difficulties arising due to background clutter and partial occlusions between objects. As the main contribution of this work, we propose a system that performs real-time object detection and pose estimation, for the purpose of dynamic robot grasping. The robot has been pre-trained to perform a small set of canonical grasps from a few fixed poses for each object. When presented with an unknown object in an arbitrary pose, the proposed approach allows the robot to detect the object identity and its actual pose, and then adapt a canonical grasp in order to be used with the new pose. For training, the system defines a canonical grasp by capturing the relative pose of an object with respect to the gripper attached to the robot's wrist. During testing, once a new pose is detected, a canonical grasp for the object is identified and then dynamically adapted by adjusting the robot arm's joint angles, so that the gripper can grasp the object in its new pose. We conducted experiments using a humanoid PR2 robot and showed that the proposed framework can detect well-textured objects, and provide accurate pose estimation in the presence of tolerable amounts of out-of-plane rotation. The performance is also illustrated by the robot successfully grasping objects from a wide range of arbitrary poses.      
### 51.GO-Finder: A Registration-Free Wearable System for Assisting Users in Finding Lost Objects via Hand-Held Object Discovery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07314.pdf)
>  People spend an enormous amount of time and effort looking for lost objects. To help remind people of the location of lost objects, various computational systems that provide information on their locations have been developed. However, prior systems for assisting people in finding objects require users to register the target objects in advance. This requirement imposes a cumbersome burden on the users, and the system cannot help remind them of unexpectedly lost objects. We propose GO-Finder ("Generic Object Finder"), a registration-free wearable camera based system for assisting people in finding an arbitrary number of objects based on two key features: automatic discovery of hand-held objects and image-based candidate selection. Given a video taken from a wearable camera, Go-Finder automatically detects and groups hand-held objects to form a visual timeline of the objects. Users can retrieve the last appearance of the object by browsing the timeline through a smartphone app. We conducted a user study to investigate how users benefit from using GO-Finder and confirmed improved accuracy and reduced mental load regarding the object search task by providing clear visual cues on object locations.      
### 52.Does Continual Learning = Catastrophic Forgetting?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07295.pdf)
>  Continual learning is known for suffering from catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where earlier learned concepts are forgotten at the expense of more recent samples. In this work, we challenge the assumption that continual learning is inevitably associated with catastrophic forgetting by presenting a set of tasks that surprisingly do not suffer from catastrophic forgetting when learned continually. We attempt to provide an insight into the property of these tasks that make them robust to catastrophic forgetting and the potential of having a proxy representation learning task for continual classification. We further introduce a novel yet simple algorithm, YASS that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the class-incremental categorization learning task. Finally, we present DyRT, a novel tool for tracking the dynamics of representation learning in continual models.

>  Optical colonoscopy (OC), the most prevalent colon cancer screening tool, has a high miss rate due to a number of factors, including the geometry of the colon (haustral fold and sharp bends occlusions), endoscopist inexperience or fatigue, endoscope field of view, etc. We present a framework to visualize the missed regions per-frame during the colonoscopy, and provides a workable clinical solution. Specifically, we make use of 3D reconstructed virtual colonoscopy (VC) data and the insight that VC and OC share the same underlying geometry but differ in color, texture and specular reflections, embedded in the OC domain. A lossy unpaired image-to-image translation model is introduced with enforced shared latent space for OC and VC. This shared latent space captures the geometric information while deferring the color, texture, and specular information creation to additional Gaussian noise input. This additional noise input can be utilized to generate one-to-many mappings from VC to OC and OC to OC.
