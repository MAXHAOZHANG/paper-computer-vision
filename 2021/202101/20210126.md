### 1.Transferable Interactiveness Knowledge for Human-Object Interaction Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10292.pdf)
>  Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is an important problem to understand how humans interact with objects. In this paper, we explore interactiveness knowledge which indicates whether a human and an object interact with each other or not. We found that interactiveness knowledge can be learned across HOI datasets and bridge the gap between diverse HOI category settings. Our core idea is to exploit an interactiveness network to learn the general interactiveness knowledge from multiple HOI datasets and perform Non-Interaction Suppression (NIS) before HOI classification in inference. On account of the generalization ability of interactiveness, interactiveness network is a transferable knowledge learner and can be cooperated with any HOI detection models to achieve desirable results. We utilize the human instance and body part features together to learn the interactiveness in hierarchical paradigm, i.e., instance-level and body part-level interactivenesses. Thereafter, a consistency task is proposed to guide the learning and extract deeper interactive visual clues. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on HICO-DET, V-COCO, and a newly constructed PaStaNet-HOI dataset. With the learned interactiveness, our method outperforms state-of-the-art HOI detection methods, verifying its efficacy and flexibility.

### 2.VConstruct: Filling Gaps in Chl-a Data Using a Variational Autoencoder  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10260.pdf)
>  Remote sensing of Chlorophyll-a is vital in monitoring climate change. Chlorphyll-a measurements give us an idea of the algae concentrations in the ocean, which lets us monitor ocean health. However, a common problem is that the satellites used to gather the data are commonly obstructed by clouds and other artifacts. This means that time series data from satellites can suffer from spatial data loss. <br>There are a number of algorithms that are able to reconstruct the missing parts of these images to varying degrees of accuracy, with Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) being the current standard. However, DINEOF is slow, suffers from accuracy loss in temporally homogenous waters, reliant on temporal data, and only able to generate a single potential reconstruction. <br>We propose a machine learning approach to reconstruction of Chlorophyll-a data using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our accuracy results to date are competitive with but slightly less accurate than DINEOF. We show the benefits of our method including vastly decreased computation time and ability to generate multiple potential reconstructions. Lastly, we outline our planned improvements and future work.      
### 3.The emergence of visual semantics through communication games  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10253.pdf)
>  The emergence of communication systems between agents which learn to play referential signalling games with realistic images has attracted a lot of attention recently. The majority of work has focused on using fixed, pretrained image feature extraction networks which potentially bias the information the agents learn to communicate. In this work, we consider a signalling game setting in which a `sender' agent must communicate the information about an image to a `receiver' who must select the correct image from many distractors. We investigate the effect of the feature extractor's weights and of the task being solved on the visual semantics learned by the models. We first demonstrate to what extent the use of pretrained feature extraction networks inductively bias the visual semantics conveyed by emergent communication channel and quantify the visual semantics that are induced. <br>We then go on to explore ways in which inductive biases can be introduced to encourage the emergence of semantically meaningful communication without the need for any form of supervised pretraining of the visual feature extractor. We impose various augmentations to the input images and additional tasks in the game with the aim to induce visual representations which capture conceptual properties of images. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that communication systems which capture visual semantics can be learned in a completely self-supervised manner by playing the right types of game. Our work bridges a gap between emergent communication research and self-supervised feature learning.      
### 4.D-Net: Siamese based Network with Mutual Attention for Volume Alignment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10248.pdf)
>  Alignment of contrast and non-contrast-enhanced imaging is essential for the quantification of changes in several biomedical applications. In particular, the extraction of cartilage shape from contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of tibiae requires accurate alignment of the bone, currently performed manually. Existing deep learning-based methods for alignment require a common template or are limited in rotation range. Therefore, we present a novel network, D-net, to estimate arbitrary rotation and translation between 3D CT scans that additionally does not require a prior standard template. D-net is an extension to the branched Siamese encoder-decoder structure connected by new mutual non-local links, which efficiently capture long-range connections of similar features between two branches. The 3D supervised network is trained and validated using preclinical CT scans of mouse tibiae with and without contrast enhancement in cartilage. The presented results show a significant improvement in the estimation of CT alignment, outperforming the current comparable methods.      
### 5.RGB-D Salient Object Detection via 3D Convolutional Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10241.pdf)
>  RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) recently has attracted increasing research interest and many deep learning methods based on encoder-decoder architectures have emerged. However, most existing RGB-D SOD models conduct feature fusion either in the single encoder or the decoder stage, which hardly guarantees sufficient cross-modal fusion ability. In this paper, we make the first attempt in addressing RGB-D SOD through 3D convolutional neural networks. The proposed model, named RD3D, aims at pre-fusion in the encoder stage and in-depth fusion in the decoder stage to effectively promote the full integration of RGB and depth streams. Specifically, RD3D first conducts pre-fusion across RGB and depth modalities through an inflated 3D encoder, and later provides in-depth feature fusion by designing a 3D decoder equipped with rich back-projection paths (RBPP) for leveraging the extensive aggregation ability of 3D convolutions. With such a progressive fusion strategy involving both the encoder and decoder, effective and thorough interaction between the two modalities can be exploited and boost the detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on six widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that RD3D performs favorably against 14 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD approaches in terms of four key evaluation metrics. Our code will be made publicly available: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/PPOLYpubki/RD3D" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 6.Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network with Gaussian-based Grasping Representation for Robotic Grasping Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10226.pdf)
>  The method of deep learning has achieved excellent results in improving the performance of robotic grasping detection. However, the deep learning methods used in general object detection are not suitable for robotic grasping detection. Current modern object detectors are difficult to strike a balance between high accuracy and fast inference speed. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust fully convolutional neural network model to perform robotic grasping pose estimation from an n-channel input image of the real grasping scene. The proposed network is a lightweight generative architecture for grasping detection in one stage. Specifically, a grasping representation based on Gaussian kernel is introduced to encode training samples, which embodies the principle of maximum central point grasping confidence. Meanwhile, to extract multi-scale information and enhance the feature discriminability, a receptive field block (RFB) is assembled to the bottleneck of our grasping detection architecture. Besides, pixel attention and channel attention are combined to automatically learn to focus on fusing context information of varying shapes and sizes by suppressing the noise feature and highlighting the grasping object feature. Extensive experiments on two public grasping datasets, Cornell and Jacquard demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in balancing accuracy and inference speed. The network is an order of magnitude smaller than other excellent algorithms while achieving better performance with an accuracy of 98.9$\%$ and 95.6$\%$ on the Cornell and Jacquard datasets, respectively.      
### 7.ISP Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10203.pdf)
>  Nowadays, many of the images captured are "observed" by machines only and not by humans, for example, robots' or autonomous cars' cameras. High-level machine vision models, such as object recognition, assume images are transformed to some canonical image space by the camera ISP. However, the camera ISP is optimized for producing visually pleasing images to human observers and not for machines, thus, one may spare the ISP compute time and apply the vision models directly to the raw data. Yet, it has been shown that training such models directly on the RAW images results in a performance drop. To mitigate this drop in performance (without the need to annotate RAW data), we use a dataset of RAW and RGB image pairs, which can be easily acquired with no human labeling. We then train a model that is applied directly to the RAW data by using knowledge distillation such that the model predictions for RAW images will be aligned with the predictions of an off-the-shelf pre-trained model for processed RGB images. Our experiments show that our performance on RAW images is significantly better than a model trained on labeled RAW images. It also reasonably matches the predictions of a pre-trained model on processed RGB images, while saving the ISP compute overhead.      
### 8.Proba-V-ref: Repurposing the Proba-V challenge for reference-aware super resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10200.pdf)
>  The PROBA-V Super-Resolution challenge distributes real low-resolution image series and corresponding high-resolution targets to advance research on Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) for satellite images. However, in the PROBA-V dataset the low-resolution image corresponding to the high-resolution target is not identified. We argue that in doing so, the challenge ranks the proposed methods not only by their MISR performance, but mainly by the heuristics used to guess which image in the series is the most similar to the high-resolution target. We demonstrate this by improving the performance obtained by the two winners of the challenge only by using a different reference image, which we compute following a simple heuristic. Based on this, we propose PROBA-V-REF a variant of the PROBA-V dataset, in which the reference image in the low-resolution series is provided, and show that the ranking between the methods changes in this setting. This is relevant to many practical use cases of MISR where the goal is to super-resolve a specific image of the series, i.e. the reference is known. The proposed PROBA-V-REF should better reflect the performance of the different methods for this reference-aware MISR problem.      
### 9.Multi-Structure Deep Segmentation with Shape Priors and Latent Adversarial Regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10173.pdf)
>  Automatic segmentation of the musculoskeletal system in pediatric magnetic resonance (MR) images is a challenging but crucial task for morphological evaluation in clinical practice. We propose a deep learning-based regularized segmentation method for multi-structure bone delineation in MR images, designed to overcome the inherent scarcity and heterogeneity of pediatric data. Based on a newly devised shape code discriminator, our adversarial regularization scheme enforces the deep network to follow a learnt shape representation of the anatomy. The novel shape priors based adversarial regularization (SPAR) exploits latent shape codes arising from ground truth and predicted masks to guide the segmentation network towards more consistent and plausible predictions. Our contribution is compared to state-of-the-art regularization methods on two pediatric musculoskeletal imaging datasets from ankle and shoulder joints.      
### 10.Learning Structral coherence Via Generative Adversarial Network for Single Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10165.pdf)
>  Among the major remaining challenges for single image super resolution (SISR) is the capacity to recover coherent images with global shapes and local details conforming to human vision system. Recent generative adversarial network (GAN) based SISR methods have yielded overall realistic SR images, however, there are always unpleasant textures accompanied with structural distortions in local regions. To target these issues, we introduce the gradient branch into the generator to preserve structural information by restoring high-resolution gradient maps in SR process. In addition, we utilize a U-net based discriminator to consider both the whole image and the detailed per-pixel authenticity, which could encourage the generator to maintain overall coherence of the reconstructed images. Moreover, we have studied objective functions and LPIPS perceptual loss is added to generate more realistic and natural details. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art perceptual-driven SR methods in perception index (PI), and obtains more geometrically consistent and visually pleasing textures in natural image restoration.      
### 11.Mask-based Data Augmentation for Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10156.pdf)
>  Semantic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a crucial component in image analysis. Training a CNN to perform semantic segmentation requires a large amount of labeled data, where the production of such labeled data is both costly and labor intensive. Semi-supervised learning algorithms address this issue by utilizing unlabeled data and so reduce the amount of labeled data needed for training. In particular, data augmentation techniques such as CutMix and ClassMix generate additional training data from existing labeled data. In this paper we propose a new approach for data augmentation, termed ComplexMix, which incorporates aspects of CutMix and ClassMix with improved performance. The proposed approach has the ability to control the complexity of the augmented data while attempting to be semantically-correct and address the tradeoff between complexity and correctness. The proposed ComplexMix approach is evaluated on a standard dataset for semantic segmentation and compared to other state-of-the-art techniques. Experimental results show that our method yields improvement over state-of-the-art methods on standard datasets for semantic image segmentation.      
### 12.Spectral Leakage and Rethinking the Kernel Size in CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10143.pdf)
>  Convolutional layers in CNNs implement linear filters which decompose the input into different frequency bands. However, most modern architectures neglect standard principles of filter design when optimizing their model choices regarding the size and shape of the convolutional kernel. In this work, we consider the well-known problem of spectral leakage caused by windowing artifacts in filtering operations in the context of CNNs. We show that the small size of CNN kernels make them susceptible to spectral leakage, which may induce performance-degrading artifacts. To address this issue, we propose the use of larger kernel sizes along with the Hamming window function to alleviate leakage in CNN architectures. We demonstrate improved classification accuracy over baselines with conventional $3\times 3$ kernels, on multiple benchmark datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, via the simple use of a standard window function in convolutional layers. Finally, we show that CNNs employing the Hamming window display increased robustness against certain types of adversarial attacks.      
### 13.Performance Evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks for Gait Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10141.pdf)
>  In this paper, a performance evaluation of well-known deep learning models in gait recognition is presented. For this purpose, the transfer learning scheme is adopted to pre-trained models in order to fit the models to the CASIA-B dataset for solving a gait recognition task. In this context, 18 popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were re-trained using Gait Energy Images (GEIs) of CASIA-B containing almost 14000 images of 124 classes under various conditions, and their performance was studied in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the performance of the studied models is managed to be explained by examining the parts of the images being considered by the models towards providing their decisions. The experimental results are very promising since almost all the models achieved a high accuracy of over 90%, which is robust to the increasing number of classes. Furthermore, an important outcome of this study is the fact that a recognition problem can be effectively solved by using CNNs pre-trained to different problems, thus eliminating the need for customized model design.      
### 14.Camera Invariant Feature Learning for Generalized Face Anti-spoofing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10075.pdf)
>  There has been an increasing consensus in learning based face anti-spoofing that the divergence in terms of camera models is causing a large domain gap in real application scenarios. We describe a framework that eliminates the influence of inherent variance from acquisition cameras at the feature level, leading to the generalized face spoofing detection model that could be highly adaptive to different acquisition devices. In particular, the framework is composed of two branches. The first branch aims to learn the camera invariant spoofing features via feature level decomposition in the high frequency domain. Motivated by the fact that the spoofing features exist not only in the high frequency domain, in the second branch the discrimination capability of extracted spoofing features is further boosted from the enhanced image based on the recomposition of the high-frequency and low-frequency information. Finally, the classification results of the two branches are fused together by a weighting strategy. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve better performance in both intra-dataset and cross-dataset settings, demonstrating the high generalization capability in various application scenarios.      
### 15.Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Localisation with Multi-scale Interpolated Gaussian Descriptors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10043.pdf)
>  Current unsupervised anomaly detection and localisation systems are commonly formulated as one-class classifiers that depend on an effective estimation of the distribution of normal images and robust criteria to identify anomalies. However, the distribution of normal images estimated by current systems tends to be unstable for classes of normal images that are under-represented in the training set, and the anomaly identification criteria commonly explored in the field does not work well for multi-scale structural and non-structural anomalies. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised anomaly detection and localisation method designed to address these two issues. More specifically, we introduce a normal image distribution estimation method that is robust to under-represented classes of normal images -- this method is based on adversarially interpolated descriptors from training images and a Gaussian classifier. We also propose a new anomaly identification criterion that can accurately detect and localise multi-scale structural and non-structural anomalies. In extensive experiments on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10 and MVTec AD data sets, our approach shows better results than the current state of the arts in the standard experimental setup for unsupervised anomaly detection and localisation.

### 16.Weakly-supervised Video Anomaly Detection with Contrastive Learning of Long and Short-range Temporal Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10030.pdf)
>  In this paper, we address the problem of weakly-supervised video anomaly detection, in which given video-level labels for training, we aim to identify in test videos, the snippets containing abnormal events. Although current methods based on multiple instance learning (MIL) show effective detection performance, they ignore important video temporal dependencies. Also, the number of abnormal snippets can vary per anomaly video, which complicates the training process of MIL-based methods because they tend to focus on the most abnormal snippet -- this can cause it to mistakenly select a normal snippet instead of an abnormal snippet, and also to fail to select all abnormal snippets available. We propose a novel method, named Multi-scale Temporal Network trained with top-K Contrastive Multiple Instance Learning (MTN-KMIL), to address the issues above. The main contributions of MTN-KMIL are: 1) a novel synthesis of a pyramid of dilated convolutions and a self-attention mechanism, with the former capturing the multi-scale short-range temporal dependencies between snippets and the latter capturing long-range temporal dependencies; and 2) a novel contrastive MIL learning method that enforces large margins between the top-K normal and abnormal video snippets at the feature representation level and anomaly score level, resulting in accurate anomaly discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three benchmark data sets (ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime and XD-Violence).

### 17.They See Me Rollin': Inherent Vulnerability of the Rolling Shutter in CMOS Image Sensors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10011.pdf)
>  Cameras have become a fundamental component of vision-based intelligent systems. As a balance between production costs and image quality, most modern cameras use Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor image sensors that implement an electronic rolling shutter mechanism, where image rows are captured consecutively rather than all-at-once. <br>In this paper, we describe how the electronic rolling shutter can be exploited using a bright, modulated light source (e.g., an inexpensive, off-the-shelf laser), to inject fine-grained image disruptions. These disruptions substantially affect camera-based computer vision systems, where high-frequency data is crucial in extracting informative features from objects. <br>We study the fundamental factors affecting a rolling shutter attack, such as environmental conditions, angle of the incident light, laser to camera distance, and aiming precision. We demonstrate how these factors affect the intensity of the injected distortion and how an adversary can take them into account by modeling the properties of the camera. We introduce a general pipeline of a practical attack, which consists of: (i) profiling several properties of the target camera and (ii) partially simulating the attack to find distortions that satisfy the adversary's goal. Then, we instantiate the attack to the scenario of object detection, where the adversary's goal is to maximally disrupt the detection of objects in the image. We show that the adversary can modulate the laser to hide up to 75% of objects perceived by state-of-the-art detectors while controlling the amount of perturbation to keep the attack inconspicuous. Our results indicate that rolling shutter attacks can substantially reduce the performance and reliability of vision-based intelligent systems.      
### 18.Gigapixel Histopathological Image Analysis using Attention-based Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09992.pdf)
>  Although CNNs are widely considered as the state-of-the-art models in various applications of image analysis, one of the main challenges still open is the training of a CNN on high resolution images. Different strategies have been proposed involving either a rescaling of the image or an individual processing of parts of the image. Such strategies cannot be applied to images, such as gigapixel histopathological images, for which a high reduction in resolution inherently effects a loss of discriminative information, and in respect of which the analysis of single parts of the image suffers from a lack of global information or implies a high workload in terms of annotating the training images in such a way as to select significant parts. We propose a method for the analysis of gigapixel histopathological images solely by using weak image-level labels. In particular, two analysis tasks are taken into account: a binary classification and a prediction of the tumor proliferation score. Our method is based on a CNN structure consisting of a compressing path and a learning path. In the compressing path, the gigapixel image is packed into a grid-based feature map by using a residual network devoted to the feature extraction of each patch into which the image has been divided. In the learning path, attention modules are applied to the grid-based feature map, taking into account spatial correlations of neighboring patch features to find regions of interest, which are then used for the final whole slide analysis. Our method integrates both global and local information, is flexible with regard to the size of the input images and only requires weak image-level labels. Comparisons with different methods of the state-of-the-art on two well known datasets, Camelyon16 and TUPAC16, have been made to confirm the validity of the proposed model.      
### 19.UniToPatho, a labeled histopathological dataset for colorectal polyps classification and adenoma dysplasia grading  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09991.pdf)
>  Histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps allows to tailor patients' management and follow up with the ultimate aim of avoiding or promptly detecting an invasive carcinoma. Colorectal polyps characterization relies on the histological analysis of tissue samples to determine the polyps malignancy and dysplasia grade. Deep neural networks achieve outstanding accuracy in medical patterns recognition, however they require large sets of annotated training images. We introduce UniToPatho, an annotated dataset of 9536 hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained patches extracted from 292 whole-slide images, meant for training deep neural networks for colorectal polyps classification and adenomas grading. We present our dataset and provide insights on how to tackle the problem of automatic colorectal polyps characterization.      
### 20.Adversarial Text-to-Image Synthesis: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09983.pdf)
>  With the advent of generative adversarial networks, synthesizing images from textual descriptions has recently become an active research area. It is a flexible and intuitive way for conditional image generation with significant progress in the last years regarding visual realism, diversity, and semantic alignment. However, the field still faces several challenges that require further research efforts such as enabling the generation of high-resolution images with multiple objects, and developing suitable and reliable evaluation metrics that correlate with human judgement. In this review, we contextualize the state of the art of adversarial text-to-image synthesis models, their development since their inception five years ago, and propose a taxonomy based on the level of supervision. We critically examine current strategies to evaluate text-to-image synthesis models, highlight shortcomings, and identify new areas of research, ranging from the development of better datasets and evaluation metrics to possible improvements in architectural design and model training. This review complements previous surveys on generative adversarial networks with a focus on text-to-image synthesis which we believe will help researchers to further advance the field.      
### 21.Weakly Supervised Thoracic Disease Localization via Disease Masks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09915.pdf)
>  To enable a deep learning-based system to be used in the medical domain as a computer-aided diagnosis system, it is essential to not only classify diseases but also present the locations of the diseases. However, collecting instance-level annotations for various thoracic diseases is expensive. Therefore, weakly supervised localization methods have been proposed that use only image-level annotation. While the previous methods presented the disease location as the most discriminative part for classification, this causes a deep network to localize wrong areas for indistinguishable X-ray images. To solve this issue, we propose a spatial attention method using disease masks that describe the areas where diseases mainly occur. We then apply the spatial attention to find the precise disease area by highlighting the highest probability of disease occurrence. Meanwhile, the various sizes, rotations and noise in chest X-ray images make generating the disease masks challenging. To reduce the variation among images, we employ an alignment module to transform an input X-ray image into a generalized image. Through extensive experiments on the NIH-Chest X-ray dataset with eight kinds of diseases, we show that the proposed method results in superior localization performances compared to state-of-the-art methods.      
### 22.A Two-stage Framework for Compound Figure Separation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09903.pdf)
>  Scientific literature contains large volumes of complex, unstructured figures that are compound in nature (i.e. composed of multiple images, graphs, and drawings). Separation of these compound figures is critical for information retrieval from these figures. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for compound figure separation, which decomposes the compound figures into constituent subfigures while preserving the association between the subfigures and their respective caption components. We propose a two-stage framework to address the proposed compound figure separation problem. In particular, the subfigure label detection module detects all subfigure labels in the first stage. Then, in the subfigure detection module, the detected subfigure labels help to detect the subfigures by optimizing the feature selection process and providing the global layout information as extra features. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework, which improves the detection precision by 9%.      
### 23.MultiFace: A Generic Training Mechanism for Boosting Face Recognition Performance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09899.pdf)
>  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and their variants have been widely used in large scale face recognition(FR) recently. Existing methods have achieved good performance on many FR benchmarks. However, most of them suffer from two major problems. First, these methods converge quite slowly since they optimize the loss functions in a high-dimensional and sparse Gaussian Sphere. Second, the high dimensionality of features, despite the powerful descriptive ability, brings difficulty to the optimization, which may lead to a sub-optimal local optimum. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet efficient training mechanism called MultiFace, where we approximate the original high-dimensional features by the ensemble of low-dimensional features. The proposed mechanism is also generic and can be easily applied to many advanced FR models. Moreover, it brings the benefits of good interpretability to FR models via the clustering effect. In detail, the ensemble of these low-dimensional features can capture complementary yet discriminative information, which can increase the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Experimental results show that the proposed mechanism can accelerate 2-3 times with the softmax loss and 1.2-1.5 times with Arcface or Cosface, while achieving state-of-the-art performances in several benchmark datasets. Especially, the significant improvements on large-scale datasets(e.g., IJB and MageFace) demonstrate the flexibility of our new training mechanism.      
### 24.Spatio-temporal Data Augmentation for Visual Surveillance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09895.pdf)
>  Visual surveillance aims to stably detect a foreground object using a continuous image acquired from a fixed camera. Recent deep learning methods based on supervised learning show superior performance compared to classical background subtraction algorithms. However, there is still a room for improvement in static foreground, dynamic background, hard shadow, illumination changes, camouflage, etc. In addition, most of the deep learning-based methods operates well on environments similar to training. If the testing environments are different from training ones, their performance degrades. As a result, additional training on those operating environments is required to ensure a good performance. Our previous work which uses spatio-temporal input data consisted of a number of past images, background images and current image showed promising results in different environments from training, although it uses a simple U-NET structure. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation technique suitable for visual surveillance for additional performance improvement using the same network used in our previous work. In deep learning, most data augmentation techniques deal with spatial-level data augmentation techniques for use in image classification and object detection. In this paper, we propose a new method of data augmentation in the spatio-temporal dimension suitable for our previous work. Two data augmentation methods of adjusting background model images and past images are proposed. Through this, it is shown that performance can be improved in difficult areas such as static foreground and ghost objects, compared to previous studies. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation using SBI, LASIESTA, and our own dataset, we show that it gives superior performance compared to deep learning-based algorithms and background subtraction algorithms.      
### 25.Cross Knowledge-based Generative Zero-Shot Learning Approach with Taxonomy Regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09892.pdf)
>  Although zero-shot learning (ZSL) has an inferential capability of recognizing new classes that have never been seen before, it always faces two fundamental challenges of the cross modality and crossdomain challenges. In order to alleviate these problems, we develop a generative network-based ZSL approach equipped with the proposed Cross Knowledge Learning (CKL) scheme and Taxonomy Regularization (TR). In our approach, the semantic features are taken as inputs, and the output is the synthesized visual features generated from the corresponding semantic features. CKL enables more relevant semantic features to be trained for semantic-to-visual feature embedding in ZSL, while Taxonomy Regularization (TR) significantly improves the intersections with unseen images with more generalized visual features generated from generative network. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets (i.e., AwA1, AwA2, CUB, NAB and aPY) show that our approach is superior to these state-of-the-art methods in terms of ZSL image classification and retrieval.      
### 26.Joint Denoising and Demosaicking with Green Channel Prior for Real-world Burst Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09870.pdf)
>  Denoising and demosaicking are essential yet correlated steps to reconstruct a full color image from the raw color filter array (CFA) data. By learning a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), significant progress has been achieved to perform denoising and demosaicking jointly. However, most existing CNN-based joint denoising and demosaicking (JDD) methods work on a single image while assuming additive white Gaussian noise, which limits their performance on real-world applications. In this work, we study the JDD problem for real-world burst images, namely JDD-B. Considering the fact that the green channel has twice the sampling rate and better quality than the red and blue channels in CFA raw data, we propose to use this green channel prior (GCP) to build a GCP-Net for the JDD-B task. In GCP-Net, the GCP features extracted from green channels are utilized to guide the feature extraction and feature upsampling of the whole image. To compensate for the shift between frames, the offset is also estimated from GCP features to reduce the impact of noise. Our GCP-Net can preserve more image structures and details than other JDD methods while removing noise. Experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy images demonstrate the effectiveness of GCP-Net quantitatively and qualitatively.      
### 27.Supervision by Registration and Triangulation for Landmark Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09866.pdf)
>  We present Supervision by Registration and Triangulation (SRT), an unsupervised approach that utilizes unlabeled multi-view video to improve the accuracy and precision of landmark detectors. Being able to utilize unlabeled data enables our detectors to learn from massive amounts of unlabeled data freely available and not be limited by the quality and quantity of manual human annotations. To utilize unlabeled data, there are two key observations: (1) the detections of the same landmark in adjacent frames should be coherent with registration, i.e., optical flow. (2) the detections of the same landmark in multiple synchronized and geometrically calibrated views should correspond to a single 3D point, i.e., multi-view consistency. Registration and multi-view consistency are sources of supervision that do not require manual labeling, thus it can be leveraged to augment existing training data during detector training. End-to-end training is made possible by differentiable registration and 3D triangulation modules. Experiments with 11 datasets and a newly proposed metric to measure precision demonstrate accuracy and precision improvements in landmark detection on both images and video.

### 28.ECOL-R: Encouraging Copying in Novel Object Captioning with Reinforcement Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09865.pdf)
>  Novel Object Captioning is a zero-shot Image Captioning task requiring describing objects not seen in the training captions, but for which information is available from external object detectors. The key challenge is to select and describe all salient detected novel objects in the input images. In this paper, we focus on this challenge and propose the ECOL-R model (Encouraging Copying of Object Labels with Reinforced Learning), a copy-augmented transformer model that is encouraged to accurately describe the novel object labels. This is achieved via a specialised reward function in the SCST reinforcement learning framework (Rennie et al., 2017) that encourages novel object mentions while maintaining the caption quality. We further restrict the SCST training to the images where detected objects are mentioned in reference captions to train the ECOL-R model. We additionally improve our copy mechanism via Abstract Labels, which transfer knowledge from known to novel object types, and a Morphological Selector, which determines the appropriate inflected forms of novel object labels. The resulting model sets new state-of-the-art on the nocaps (Agrawal et al., 2019) and held-out COCO (Hendricks et al., 2016) benchmarks.      
### 29.Applications of Deep Learning in Fundus Images: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09864.pdf)
>  The use of fundus images for the early screening of eye diseases is of great clinical importance. Due to its powerful performance, deep learning is becoming more and more popular in related applications, such as lesion segmentation, biomarkers segmentation, disease diagnosis and image synthesis. Therefore, it is very necessary to summarize the recent developments in deep learning for fundus images with a review paper. In this review, we introduce 143 application papers with a carefully designed hierarchy. Moreover, 33 publicly available datasets are presented. Summaries and analyses are provided for each task. Finally, limitations common to all tasks are revealed and possible solutions are given. We will also release and regularly update the state-of-the-art results and newly-released datasets at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/nkicsl/Fundus" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> Review to adapt to the rapid development of this field.      
### 30.Weakly Supervised Learning for Facial Behavior Analysis : A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09858.pdf)
>  In the recent years, there has been a shift in facial behavior analysis from the laboratory-controlled conditions to the challenging in-the-wild conditions due to the superior performance of deep learning based approaches for many real world applications.However, the performance of deep learning approaches relies on the amount of training data. One of the major problems with data acquisition is the requirement of annotations for large amount of training data. Labeling process of huge training data demands lot of human support with strong domain expertise for facial expressions or action units, which is difficult to obtain in real-time environments.Moreover, labeling process is highly vulnerable to ambiguity of expressions or action units, especially for intensities due to the bias induced by the domain experts. Therefore, there is an imperative need to address the problem of facial behavior analysis with weak annotations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of weakly supervised learning (WSL) approaches for facial behavior analysis with both categorical as well as dimensional labels along with the challenges and potential research directions associated with it. First, we introduce various types of weak annotations in the context of facial behavior analysis and the corresponding challenges associated with it. We then systematically review the existing state-of-the-art approaches and provide a taxonomy of these approaches along with their insights and limitations. In addition, widely used data-sets in the reviewed literature and the performance of these approaches along with evaluation principles are summarized. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and opportunities along with the potential research directions in order to apply facial behavior analysis with weak labels in real life situations.      
### 31.ATRM: Attention-based Task-level Relation Module for GNN-based Few-shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09840.pdf)
>  Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown powerful ability to handle few-shot classification problem, which aims at classifying unseen samples when trained with limited labeled samples per class. GNN-based few-shot learning architectures mostly replace traditional metric with a learnable GNN. In the GNN, the nodes are set as the samples embedding, and the relationship between two connected nodes can be obtained by a network, the input of which is the difference of their embedding features. We consider this method of measuring relation of samples only models the sample-to-sample relation, while neglects the specificity of different tasks. That is, this method of measuring relation does not take the task-level information into account. To this end, we propose a new relation measure method, namely the attention-based task-level relation module (ATRM), to explicitly model the task-level relation of one sample to all the others. The proposed module captures the relation representations between nodes by considering the sample-to-task instead of sample-to-sample embedding features. We conducted extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets: mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and CIFAR-FS. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module is effective for GNN-based few-shot learning.      
### 32.Exploring ensembles and uncertainty minimization in denoising networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09798.pdf)
>  The development of neural networks has greatly improved the performance in various computer vision tasks. In the filed of image denoising, convolutional neural network based methods such as DnCNN break through the limits of classical methods, achieving better quantitative results. However, the epistemic uncertainty existing in neural networks limits further improvements in their performance over denoising tasks. Therefore, we develop and study different solutions to minimize uncertainty and further improve the removal of noise. From the perspective of ensemble learning, we implement manipulations to noisy images from the point of view of spatial and frequency domains and then denoise them using pre-trained denoising networks. We propose a fusion model consisting of two attention modules, which focus on assigning the proper weights to pixels and channels. The experimental results show that our model achieves better performance on top of the baseline of regular pre-trained denoising networks.      
### 33.cGANs for Cartoon to Real-life Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09793.pdf)
>  The image-to-image translation is a learning task to establish a visual mapping between an input and output image. The task has several variations differentiated based on the purpose of the translation, such as synthetic to real translation, photo to caricature translation, and many others. The problem has been tackled using different approaches, either through traditional computer vision methods, as well as deep learning approaches in recent trends. One approach currently deemed popular and effective is using the conditional generative adversarial network, also known shortly as cGAN. It is adapted to perform image-to-image translation tasks with typically two networks: a generator and a discriminator. This project aims to evaluate the robustness of the Pix2Pix model by applying the Pix2Pix model to datasets consisting of cartoonized images. Using the Pix2Pix model, it should be possible to train the network to generate real-life images from the cartoonized images.      
### 34.A Joint Representation Learning and Feature Modeling Approach for One-class Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09782.pdf)
>  One-class recognition is traditionally approached either as a representation learning problem or a feature modeling problem. In this work, we argue that both of these approaches have their own limitations; and a more effective solution can be obtained by combining the two. The proposed approach is based on the combination of a generative framework and a one-class classification method. First, we learn generative features using the one-class data with a generative framework. We augment the learned features with the corresponding reconstruction errors to obtain augmented features. Then, we qualitatively identify a suitable feature distribution that reduces the redundancy in the chosen classifier space. Finally, we force the augmented features to take the form of this distribution using an adversarial framework. We test the effectiveness of the proposed method on three one-class classification tasks and obtain state-of-the-art results.      
### 35.Fighting deepfakes by detecting GAN DCT anomalies  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09781.pdf)
>  Synthetic multimedia content created through AI technologies, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), applied to human faces can brings serious social and political consequences in the private life of every person. State-of-the-art algorithms use deep neural networks to detect a fake content but unfortunately almost all approaches appear to be neither generalizable nor explainable. A new fast detection method able to discriminate Deepfake images with blazing speed and high precision is exposed. By employing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) transform, anomalous frequencies in real and Deepfake datasets were analyzed. The \beta statistics inferred by the AC coefficients distribution have been the key to recognize GAN-engine generated data. The technique has been validated on pristine high quality faces synthesized by different GANs architectures. Experiments carried out show that the method is innovative, exceeds the state-of-the-art and also gives many insights in terms of explainability      
### 36.Iterative Greedy Matching for 3D Human Pose Tracking from Multiple Views  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09745.pdf)
>  In this work we propose an approach for estimating 3D human poses of multiple people from a set of calibrated cameras. Estimating 3D human poses from multiple views has several compelling properties: human poses are estimated within a global coordinate space and multiple cameras provide an extended field of view which helps in resolving ambiguities, occlusions and motion blur. Our approach builds upon a real-time 2D multi-person pose estimation system and greedily solves the association problem between multiple views. We utilize bipartite matching to track multiple people over multiple frames. This proofs to be especially efficient as problems associated with greedy matching such as occlusion can be easily resolved in 3D. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks and may serve as a baseline for future work.      
### 37.Classic versus deep approaches to address computer vision challenges  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09744.pdf)
>  Computer vision and image processing address many challenging applications. While the last decade has seen deep neural network architectures revolutionizing those fields, early methods relied on 'classic', i.e., non-learned approaches. In this study, we explore the differences between classic and deep learning (DL) algorithms to gain new insight regarding which is more suitable for a given application. The focus is on two challenging ill-posed problems, namely faint edge detection and multispectral image registration, studying recent state-of-the-art DL and classic solutions. While those DL algorithms outperform classic methods in terms of accuracy and development time, they tend to have higher resource requirements and are unable to perform outside their training space. Moreover, classic algorithms are more transparent, which facilitates their adoption for real-life applications. As both classes of approaches have unique strengths and limitations, the choice of a solution is clearly application dependent.      
### 38.Exploitation of Image Statistics with Sparse Coding in the Case of Stereo Vision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09710.pdf)
>  The sparse coding algorithm has served as a model for early processing in mammalian vision. It has been assumed that the brain uses sparse coding to exploit statistical properties of the sensory stream. We hypothesize that sparse coding discovers patterns from the data set, which can be used to estimate a set of stimulus parameters by simple readout. In this study, we chose a model of stereo vision to test our hypothesis. We used the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA), followed by a naïve Bayes classifier, to infer stereo disparity. From the results we report three observations. First, disparity inference was successful with this naturalistic processing pipeline. Second, an expanded, highly redundant representation is required to robustly identify the input patterns. Third, the inference error can be predicted from the number of active coefficients in the LCA representation. We conclude that sparse coding can generate a suitable general representation for subsequent inference tasks. Keywords: Sparse coding; Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA); Efficient coding; Compact code; Probabilistic inference; Stereo vision      
### 39.Pruning and Quantization for Deep Neural Network Acceleration: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09671.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have been applied in many applications exhibiting extraordinary abilities in the field of computer vision. However, complex network architectures challenge efficient real-time deployment and require significant computation resources and energy costs. These challenges can be overcome through optimizations such as network compression. This paper provides a survey on two types of network compression: pruning and quantization. We compare current techniques, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, provide guidance for compressing networks, and discuss possible future compression techniques.      
### 40.Grad-CAM guided channel-spatial attention module for fine-grained visual classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09666.pdf)
>  Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) is becoming an important research field, due to its wide applications and the rapid development of computer vision technologies. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the FGVC usually employ attention mechanisms to first capture the semantic parts and then discover their subtle differences between distinct classes. The channel-spatial attention mechanisms, which focus on the discriminative channels and regions simultaneously, have significantly improved the classification performance. However, the existing attention modules are poorly guided since part-based detectors in the FGVC depend on the network learning ability without the supervision of part annotations. As obtaining such part annotations is labor-intensive, some visual localization and explanation methods, such as gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM), can be utilized for supervising the attention mechanism. We propose a Grad-CAM guided channel-spatial attention module for the FGVC, which employs the Grad-CAM to supervise and constrain the attention weights by generating the coarse localization maps. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct comprehensive experiments on three popular FGVC datasets, including CUB-$200$-$2011$, Stanford Cars, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets. The proposed method outperforms the SOTA attention modules in the FGVC task. In addition, visualizations of feature maps also demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against the SOTA approaches.      
### 41.Computational Intelligence Approach to Improve the Classification Accuracy of Brain Neoplasm in MRI Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09658.pdf)
>  Automatic detection of brain neoplasm in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is gaining importance in many medical diagnostic applications. This report presents two improvements for brain neoplasm detection in MRI data: an advanced preprocessing technique is proposed to improve the area of interest in MRI data and a hybrid technique using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The learning algorithm for SVM is modified with the addition of cost function to minimize false positive prediction addressing the errors in MRI data diagnosis. The proposed approach can effectively detect the presence of neoplasm and also predict whether it is cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). To check the effectiveness of the proposed preprocessing technique, it is inspected visually and evaluated using training performance metrics. A comparison study between the proposed classification technique and the existing techniques was performed. The result showed that the proposed approach outperformed in terms of accuracy and can handle errors in classification better than the existing approaches.      
### 42.VIO-Aided Structure from Motion Under Challenging Environments  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09657.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a robust and efficient Structure from Motion pipeline for accurate 3D reconstruction under challenging environments by leveraging the camera pose information from a visual-inertial odometry. Specifically, we propose a geometric verification method to filter out mismatches by considering the prior geometric configuration of candidate image pairs. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient and scalable reconstruction approach that relies on batched image registration and robust bundle adjustment, both leveraging the reliable local odometry estimation. Extensive experimental results show that our pipeline performs better than the state-of-the-art SfM approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness for challenging sequential image collections.      
### 43.A Dual-branch Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09643.pdf)
>  Deep learning is a rapidly developing approach in the field of infrared and visible image fusion. In this context, the use of dense blocks in deep networks significantly improves the utilization of shallow information, and the combination of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) also improves the fusion performance of two source images. We propose a new method based on dense blocks and GANs , and we directly insert the input image-visible light image in each layer of the entire network. We use SSIM and gradient loss functions that are more consistent with perception instead of mean square error loss. After the adversarial training between the generator and the discriminator, we show that a trained end-to-end fusion network -- the generator network -- is finally obtained. Our experiments show that the fused images obtained by our approach achieve good score based on multiple evaluation indicators. Further, our fused images have better visual effects in multiple sets of contrasts, which are more satisfying to human visual perception.      
### 44.Image Compression with Encoder-Decoder Matched Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09642.pdf)
>  In recent years, layered image compression is demonstrated to be a promising direction, which encodes a compact representation of the input image and apply an up-sampling network to reconstruct the image. To further improve the quality of the reconstructed image, some works transmit the semantic segment together with the compressed image data. Consequently, the compression ratio is also decreased because extra bits are required for transmitting the semantic segment. To solve this problem, we propose a new layered image compression framework with encoder-decoder matched semantic segmentation (EDMS). And then, followed by the semantic segmentation, a special convolution neural network is used to enhance the inaccurate semantic segment. As a result, the accurate semantic segment can be obtained in the decoder without requiring extra bits. The experimental results show that the proposed EDMS framework can get up to 35.31% BD-rate reduction over the HEVC-based (BPG) codec, 5% bitrate, and 24% encoding time saving compare to the state-of-the-art semantic-based image codec.      
### 45.OpenGF: An Ultra-Large-Scale Ground Filtering Dataset Built Upon Open ALS Point Clouds Around the World  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09641.pdf)
>  Ground filtering has remained a widely studied but incompletely resolved bottleneck for decades in the automatic generation of high-precision digital elevation model, due to the dramatic changes of topography and the complex structures of objects. The recent breakthrough of supervised deep learning algorithms in 3D scene understanding brings new solutions for better solving such problems. However, there are few large-scale and scene-rich public datasets dedicated to ground extraction, which considerably limits the development of effective deep-learning-based ground filtering methods. To this end, we present OpenGF, first Ultra-Large-Scale Ground Filtering dataset covering over 47 $km^2$ of 9 different typical terrain scenes built upon open ALS point clouds of 4 different countries around the world. OpenGF contains more than half a billion finely labeled ground and non-ground points, thousands of times the number of labeled points than the de facto standard ISPRS filtertest dataset. We extensively evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art rule-based algorithms and 3D semantic segmentation networks on our dataset and provide a comprehensive analysis. The results have confirmed the capability of OpenGF to train deep learning models effectively. This dataset will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Nathan-UW/OpenGF" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> to promote more advancing research for ground filtering and large-scale 3D geographic environment understanding.      
### 46.FlowReg: Fast Deformable Unsupervised Medical Image Registration using Optical Flow  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09639.pdf)
>  We propose FlowReg, a deep learning-based framework for unsupervised image registration for neuroimaging applications. The system is composed of two architectures that are trained sequentially: FlowReg-A which affinely corrects for gross differences between moving and fixed volumes in 3D followed by FlowReg-O which performs pixel-wise deformations on a slice-by-slice basis for fine tuning in 2D. The affine network regresses the 3D affine matrix based on a correlation loss function that enforces global similarity. The deformable network operates on 2D image slices based on the optical flow network FlowNet-Simple but with three loss components. The photometric loss minimizes pixel intensity differences differences, the smoothness loss encourages similar magnitudes between neighbouring vectors, and a correlation loss that is used to maintain the intensity similarity between fixed and moving image slices. The proposed method is compared to four open source registration techniques ANTs, Demons, SE, and Voxelmorph. In total, 4643 FLAIR MR imaging volumes are used from dementia and vascular disease cohorts, acquired from over 60 international centres with varying acquisition parameters. A battery of quantitative novel registration validation metrics are proposed that focus on the structural integrity of tissues, spatial alignment, and intensity similarity. Experimental results show FlowReg (FlowReg-A+O) performs better than iterative-based registration algorithms for intensity and spatial alignment metrics with a Pixelwise Agreement of 0.65, correlation coefficient of 0.80, and Mutual Information of 0.29. Among the deep learning frameworks, FlowReg-A or FlowReg-A+O provided the highest performance over all but one of the metrics. Results show that FlowReg is able to obtain high intensity and spatial similarity while maintaining the shape and structure of anatomy and pathology.      
### 47.DenseNet for Breast Tumor Classification in Mammographic Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09637.pdf)
>  Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women, and the second main cause of death. Breast cancer screening is an efficient method to detect indeterminate breast lesions early. The common approaches of screening for women are tomosynthesis and mammography images. However, the traditional manual diagnosis requires an intense workload by pathologists, who are prone to diagnostic errors. Thus, the aim of this study is to build a deep convolutional neural network method for automatic detection, segmentation, and classification of breast lesions in mammography images. Based on deep learning the Mask-CNN (RoIAlign) method was developed to features selection and extraction; and the classification was carried out by DenseNet architecture. Finally, the precision and accuracy of the model is evaluated by cross validation matrix and AUC curve. To summarize, the findings of this study may provide a helpful to improve the diagnosis and efficiency in the automatic tumor localization through the medical image classification.      
### 48.A Comprehensive Evaluation Framework for Deep Model Robustness  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09617.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide area of applications. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which motivates the adversarial defense. By adopting simple evaluation metrics, most of the current defenses only conduct incomplete evaluations, which are far from providing comprehensive understandings of the limitations of these defenses. Thus, most proposed defenses are quickly shown to be attacked successfully, which result in the "arm race" phenomenon between attack and defense. To mitigate this problem, we establish a model robustness evaluation framework containing a comprehensive, rigorous, and coherent set of evaluation metrics, which could fully evaluate model robustness and provide deep insights into building robust models. With 23 evaluation metrics in total, our framework primarily focuses on the two key factors of adversarial learning (\ie, data and model). Through neuron coverage and data imperceptibility, we use data-oriented metrics to measure the integrity of test examples; by delving into model structure and behavior, we exploit model-oriented metrics to further evaluate robustness in the adversarial setting. To fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct large-scale experiments on multiple datasets including CIFAR-10 and SVHN using different models and defenses with our open-source platform AISafety. Overall, our paper aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework which could demonstrate detailed inspections of the model robustness, and we hope that our paper can inspire further improvement to the model robustness.      
### 49.Learning degraded image classification with restoration data fidelity  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09606.pdf)
>  Learning-based methods especially with convolutional neural networks (CNN) are continuously showing superior performance in computer vision applications, ranging from image classification to restoration. For image classification, most existing works focus on very clean images such as images in Caltech-256 and ImageNet datasets. However, in most realistic scenarios, the acquired images may suffer from degradation. One important and interesting problem is to combine image classification and restoration tasks to improve the performance of CNN-based classification networks on degraded images. In this report, we explore the influence of degradation types and levels on four widely-used classification networks, and the use of a restoration network to eliminate the degradation's influence. We also propose a novel method leveraging a fidelity map to calibrate the image features obtained by pre-trained classification networks. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms the pre-trained networks under all degradation levels and types with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and it even outperforms the re-trained networks for degraded images under low degradation levels. We also show that the proposed method is a model-agnostic approach that benefits different classification networks. Our results reveal that the proposed method is a promising solution to mitigate the effect caused by image degradation.      
### 50.BSUV-Net 2.0: Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentations for Video-AgnosticSupervised Background Subtraction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09585.pdf)
>  Background subtraction (BGS) is a fundamental video processing task which is a key component of many applications. Deep learning-based supervised algorithms achieve very promising results in BGS, however, most of these algorithms are optimized for either a specific video or a group of videos, and their performance decreases significantly when applied to unseen videos. Recently, several papers addressed this problem and proposed video-agnostic supervised BGS algorithms. However, nearly all of the data augmentations used in these works are limited to spatial domain and do not account for temporal variations naturally occurring in video data. In this work, we introduce spatio-temporal data augmentations and apply it to one of the leading video-agnostic BGS algorithms, BSUV-Net. Our new model trained using the proposed data augmentations, named BSUV-Net 2.0, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on unseen videos. We also develop a real-time variant of our model named Fast BSUV-Net 2.0 with performance close to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we introduce a new cross-validation training and evaluation strategy for the CDNet-2014 dataset that makes it possible to fairly and easily compare the performance of various video-agnostic supervised BGS algorithms. The source code of BSUV-Net 2.0 will be published.      
### 51.S-BEV: Semantic Birds-Eye View Representation for Weather and Lighting Invariant 3-DoF Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09569.pdf)
>  We describe a light-weight, weather and lighting invariant, Semantic Bird's Eye View (S-BEV) signature for vision-based vehicle re-localization. A topological map of S-BEV signatures is created during the first traversal of the route, which are used for coarse localization in subsequent route traversal. A fine-grained localizer is then trained to output the global 3-DoF pose of the vehicle using its S-BEV and its coarse localization. We conduct experiments on vKITTI2 virtual dataset and show the potential of the S-BEV to be robust to weather and lighting. We also demonstrate results with 2 vehicles on a 22 km long highway route in the Ford AV dataset.      
### 52.A Transferable Anti-Forensic Attack on Forensic CNNs Using A Generative Adversarial Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09568.pdf)
>  With the development of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become widely used in multimedia forensics for tasks such as detecting and identifying image forgeries. Meanwhile, anti-forensic attacks have been developed to fool these CNN-based forensic algorithms. Previous anti-forensic attacks often were designed to remove forgery traces left by a single manipulation operation as opposed to a set of manipulations. Additionally, recent research has shown that existing anti-forensic attacks against forensic CNNs have poor transferability, i.e. they are unable to fool other forensic CNNs that were not explicitly used during training. In this paper, we propose a new anti-forensic attack framework designed to remove forensic traces left by a variety of manipulation operations. This attack is transferable, i.e. it can be used to attack forensic CNNs are unknown to the attacker, and it introduces only minimal distortions that are imperceptible to human eyes. Our proposed attack utilizes a generative adversarial network (GAN) to build a generator that can attack color images of any size. We achieve attack transferability through the use of a new training strategy and loss function. We conduct extensive experiment to demonstrate that our attack can fool many state-of-art forensic CNNs with varying levels of knowledge available to the attacker.      
### 53.Network-Agnostic Knowledge Transfer for Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09560.pdf)
>  Conventional transfer learning leverages weights of pre-trained networks, but mandates the need for similar neural architectures. Alternatively, knowledge distillation can transfer knowledge between heterogeneous networks but often requires access to the original training data or additional generative networks. Knowledge transfer between networks can be improved by being agnostic to the choice of network architecture and reducing the dependence on original training data. We propose a knowledge transfer approach from a teacher to a student network wherein we train the student on an independent transferal dataset, whose annotations are generated by the teacher. Experiments were conducted on five state-of-the-art networks for semantic segmentation and seven datasets across three imaging modalities. We studied knowledge transfer from a single teacher, combination of knowledge transfer and fine-tuning, and knowledge transfer from multiple teachers. The student model with a single teacher achieved similar performance as the teacher; and the student model with multiple teachers achieved better performance than the teachers. The salient features of our algorithm include: 1)no need for original training data or generative networks, 2) knowledge transfer between different architectures, 3) ease of implementation for downstream tasks by using the downstream task dataset as the transferal dataset, 4) knowledge transfer of an ensemble of models, trained independently, into one student model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective for knowledge transfer and easily tunable.      
### 54.Real-Time, Flight-Ready, Non-Cooperative Spacecraft Pose Estimation Using Monocular Imagery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09553.pdf)
>  A key requirement for autonomous on-orbit proximity operations is the estimation of a target spacecraft's relative pose (position and orientation). It is desirable to employ monocular cameras for this problem due to their low cost, weight, and power requirements. This work presents a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based monocular pose estimation system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with low computational demand. In combination with a Blender-based synthetic data generation scheme, the system demonstrates the ability to generalize from purely synthetic training data to real in-space imagery of the Northrop Grumman Enhanced Cygnus spacecraft. Additionally, the system achieves real-time performance on low-power flight-like hardware.      
### 55.Memory-Efficient Semi-Supervised Continual Learning: The World is its Own Replay Buffer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09536.pdf)
>  Rehearsal is a critical component for class-incremental continual learning, yet it requires a substantial memory budget. Our work investigates whether we can significantly reduce this memory budget by leveraging unlabeled data from an agent's environment in a realistic and challenging continual learning paradigm. Specifically, we explore and formalize a novel semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL) setting, where labeled data is scarce yet non-i.i.d. unlabeled data from the agent's environment is plentiful. Importantly, data distributions in the SSCL setting are realistic and therefore reflect object class correlations between, and among, the labeled and unlabeled data distributions. We show that a strategy built on pseudo-labeling, consistency regularization, Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection, and knowledge distillation reduces forgetting in this setting. Our approach, DistillMatch, increases performance over the state-of-the-art by no less than 8.7% average task accuracy and up to a 54.5% increase in average task accuracy in SSCL CIFAR-100 experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate that DistillMatch can save up to 0.23 stored images per processed unlabeled image compared to the next best method which only saves 0.08. Our results suggest that focusing on realistic correlated distributions is a significantly new perspective, which accentuates the importance of leveraging the world's structure as a continual learning strategy.      
### 56.Contrastive Prototype Learning with Augmented Embeddings for Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09499.pdf)
>  Most recent few-shot learning (FSL) methods are based on meta-learning with episodic training. In each meta-training episode, a discriminative feature embedding and/or classifier are first constructed from a support set in an inner loop, and then evaluated in an outer loop using a query set for model updating. This query set sample centered learning objective is however intrinsically limited in addressing the lack of training data problem in the support set. In this paper, a novel contrastive prototype learning with augmented embeddings (CPLAE) model is proposed to overcome this limitation. First, data augmentations are introduced to both the support and query sets with each sample now being represented as an augmented embedding (AE) composed of concatenated embeddings of both the original and augmented versions. Second, a novel support set class prototype centered contrastive loss is proposed for contrastive prototype learning (CPL). With a class prototype as an anchor, CPL aims to pull the query samples of the same class closer and those of different classes further away. This support set sample centered loss is highly complementary to the existing query centered loss, fully exploiting the limited training data in each episode. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed CPLAE achieves new state-of-the-art.      
### 57.Sequence-based Dynamic Handwriting Analysis for Parkinson's Disease Detection with One-dimensional Convolutions and BiGRUs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09461.pdf)
>  Parkinson's disease (PD) is commonly characterized by several motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, akinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The analysis of patients' fine motor control, particularly handwriting, is a powerful tool to support PD assessment. Over the years, various dynamic attributes of handwriting, such as pen pressure, stroke speed, in-air time, etc., which can be captured with the help of online handwriting acquisition tools, have been evaluated for the identification of PD. Motion events, and their associated spatio-temporal properties captured in online handwriting, enable effective classification of PD patients through the identification of unique sequential patterns. This paper proposes a novel classification model based on one-dimensional convolutions and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) to assess the potential of sequential information of handwriting in identifying Parkinsonian symptoms. One-dimensional convolutions are applied to raw sequences as well as derived features; the resulting sequences are then fed to BiGRU layers to achieve the final classification. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on the PaHaW dataset and achieved competitive results on the NewHandPD dataset.      
### 58.Error Diffusion Halftoning Against Adversarial Examples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09451.pdf)
>  Adversarial examples contain carefully crafted perturbations that can fool deep neural networks (DNNs) into making wrong predictions. Enhancing the adversarial robustness of DNNs has gained considerable interest in recent years. Although image transformation-based defenses were widely considered at an earlier time, most of them have been defeated by adaptive attacks. In this paper, we propose a new image transformation defense based on error diffusion halftoning, and combine it with adversarial training to defend against adversarial examples. Error diffusion halftoning projects an image into a 1-bit space and diffuses quantization error to neighboring pixels. This process can remove adversarial perturbations from a given image while maintaining acceptable image quality in the meantime in favor of recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to improve adversarial robustness even under advanced adaptive attacks, while most of the other image transformation-based defenses do not. We show that a proper image transformation can still be an effective defense approach.      
### 59.A Pressure Ulcer Care System For Remote Medical Assistance: Residual U-Net with an Attention Model Based for Wound Area Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09433.pdf)
>  Increasing numbers of patients with disabilities or elderly people with mobility issues often suffer from a pressure ulcer. The affected areas need regular checks, but they have a difficulty in accessing a hospital. Some remote diagnosis systems are being used for them, but there are limitations in checking a patient's status regularly. In this paper, we present a remote medical assistant that can help pressure ulcer management with image processing techniques. The proposed system includes a mobile application with a deep learning model for wound segmentation and analysis. As there are not enough data to train the deep learning model, we make use of a pretrained model from a relevant domain and data augmentation that is appropriate for this task. First of all, an image preprocessing method using bilinear interpolation is used to resize images and normalize the images. Second, for data augmentation, we use rotation, reflection, and a watershed algorithm. Third, we use a pretrained deep learning model generated from skin wound images similar to pressure ulcer images. Finally, we added an attention module that can provide hints on the pressure ulcer image features. The resulting model provides an accuracy of 99.0%, an intersection over union (IoU) of 99.99%, and a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 93.4% for pressure ulcer segmentation, which is better than existing results.      
### 60.Deep Anti-aliasing of Whole Focal Stack Using its Slice Spectrum  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09420.pdf)
>  The paper aims at removing the aliasing effects for the whole focal stack generated from a sparse 3D light field, while keeping the consistency across all the focal layers.We first explore the structural characteristics embedded in the focal stack slice and its corresponding frequency-domain representation, i.e., the focal stack spectrum (FSS). We also observe that the energy distribution of FSS always locates within the same triangular area under different angular sampling rates, additionally the continuity of point spread function (PSF) is intrinsically maintained in the FSS. Based on these two findings, we propose a learning-based FSS reconstruction approach for one-time aliasing removing over the whole focal stack. What's more, a novel conjugate-symmetric loss function is proposed for the optimization. Compared to previous works, our method avoids an explicit depth estimation, and can handle challenging large-disparity scenarios. Experimental results on both synthetic and real light field datasets show the superiority of the proposed approach for different scenes and various angular sampling rates.      
### 61.Exploiting Web Images for Fine-Grained Visual Recognition by Eliminating Noisy Samples and Utilizing Hard Ones  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09412.pdf)
>  Labeling objects at a subordinate level typically requires expert knowledge, which is not always available when using random annotators. As such, learning directly from web images for fine-grained recognition has attracted broad attention. However, the presence of label noise and hard examples in web images are two obstacles for training robust fine-grained recognition models. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel approach for removing irrelevant samples from real-world web images during training, while employing useful hard examples to update the network. Thus, our approach can alleviate the harmful effects of irrelevant noisy web images and hard examples to achieve better performance. Extensive experiments on three commonly used fine-grained datasets demonstrate that our approach is far superior to current state-of-the-art web-supervised methods.      
### 62.4D Atlas: Statistical Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Variability in Longitudinal 3D Shape Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09403.pdf)
>  We propose a novel framework to learn the spatiotemporal variability in longitudinal 3D shape data sets, which contain observations of subjects that evolve and deform over time. This problem is challenging since surfaces come with arbitrary spatial and temporal parameterizations. Thus, they need to be spatially registered and temporally aligned onto each other. We solve this spatiotemporal registration problem using a Riemannian approach. We treat a 3D surface as a point in a shape space equipped with an elastic metric that measures the amount of bending and stretching that the surfaces undergo. A 4D surface can then be seen as a trajectory in this space. With this formulation, the statistical analysis of 4D surfaces becomes the problem of analyzing trajectories embedded in a nonlinear Riemannian manifold. However, computing spatiotemporal registration and statistics on nonlinear spaces relies on complex nonlinear optimizations. Our core contribution is the mapping of the surfaces to the space of Square-Root Normal Fields (SRNF) where the L2 metric is equivalent to the partial elastic metric in the space of surfaces. By solving the spatial registration in the SRNF space, analyzing 4D surfaces becomes the problem of analyzing trajectories embedded in the SRNF space, which is Euclidean. Here, we develop the building blocks that enable such analysis. These include the spatiotemporal registration of arbitrarily parameterized 4D surfaces even in the presence of large elastic deformations and large variations in their execution rates, the computation of geodesics between 4D surfaces, the computation of statistical summaries, such as means and modes of variation, and the synthesis of random 4D surfaces. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework using 4D facial surfaces and 4D human body shapes.      
### 63.Next-best-view Regression using a 3D Convolutional Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09397.pdf)
>  Automated three-dimensional (3D) object reconstruction is the task of building a geometric representation of a physical object by means of sensing its surface. Even though new single view reconstruction techniques can predict the surface, they lead to incomplete models, specially, for non commons objects such as antique objects or art sculptures. Therefore, to achieve the task's goals, it is essential to automatically determine the locations where the sensor will be placed so that the surface will be completely observed. This problem is known as the next-best-view problem. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to address the problem. The proposed approach trains a 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) with previous reconstructions in order to regress the \btxt{position of the} next-best-view. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first works that directly infers the next-best-view in a continuous space using a data-driven approach for the 3D object reconstruction task. We have validated the proposed approach making use of two groups of experiments. In the first group, several variants of the proposed architecture are analyzed. Predicted next-best-views were observed to be closely positioned to the ground truth. In the second group of experiments, the proposed approach is requested to reconstruct several unseen objects, namely, objects not considered by the 3D CNN during training nor validation. Coverage percentages of up to 90 \% were observed. With respect to current state-of-the-art methods, the proposed approach improves the performance of previous next-best-view classification approaches and it is quite fast in running time (3 frames per second), given that it does not compute the expensive ray tracing required by previous information metrics.      
### 64.Fixed Viewpoint Mirror Surface Reconstruction under an Uncalibrated Camera  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09392.pdf)
>  This paper addresses the problem of mirror surface reconstruction, and proposes a solution based on observing the reflections of a moving reference plane on the mirror surface. Unlike previous approaches which require tedious calibration, our method can recover the camera intrinsics, the poses of the reference plane, as well as the mirror surface from the observed reflections of the reference plane under at least three unknown distinct poses. We first show that the 3D poses of the reference plane can be estimated from the reflection correspondences established between the images and the reference plane. We then form a bunch of 3D lines from the reflection correspondences, and derive an analytical solution to recover the line projection matrix. We transform the line projection matrix to its equivalent camera projection matrix, and propose a cross-ratio based formulation to optimize the camera projection matrix by minimizing reprojection errors. The mirror surface is then reconstructed based on the optimized cross-ratio constraint. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our method.      
### 65.The Role of Edges in Line Drawing Perception  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09376.pdf)
>  It has often been conjectured that the effectiveness of line drawings can be explained by the similarity of edge images to line drawings. This paper presents several problems with explaining line drawing perception in terms of edges, and how the recently-proposed Realism Hypothesis of Hertzmann (2020) resolves these problems. There is nonetheless existing evidence that edges are often the best features for predicting where people draw lines; this paper describes how the Realism Hypothesis can explain this evidence.      
### 66.Vessel-CAPTCHA: an efficient learning framework for vessel annotation and segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09321.pdf)
>  The use of deep learning techniques for 3D brain vessel image segmentation has not been as widespread as for the segmentation of other organs and tissues. This can be explained by two factors. First, deep learning techniques tend to show poor performances at the segmentation of relatively small objects compared to the size of the full image. Second, due to the complexity of vascular trees and the small size of vessels, it is challenging to obtain the amount of annotated training data typically needed by deep learning methods. To address these problems, we propose a novel annotation-efficient deep learning vessel segmentation framework. The framework avoids pixel-wise annotations, only requiring patch-level labels to discriminate between vessel and non-vessel 2D patches in the training set, in a setup similar to the CAPTCHAs used to differentiate humans from bots in web applications. The user-provided annotations are used for two tasks: 1) to automatically generate pixel-wise labels for vessels and background in each patch, which are used to train a segmentation network, and 2) to train a classifier network. The classifier network allows to generate additional weak patch labels, further reducing the annotation burden, and it acts as a noise filter for poor quality images. We use this framework for the segmentation of the cerebrovascular tree in Time-of-Flight angiography (TOF) and Susceptibility-Weighted Images (SWI). The results show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while reducing the annotation time by up to 80% with respect to learning-based segmentation methods using pixel-wise labels for training      
### 67.Machine Learning in LiDAR 3D point clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09318.pdf)
>  LiDAR point clouds contain measurements of complicated natural scenes and can be used to update digital elevation models, glacial monitoring, detecting faults and measuring uplift detecting, forest inventory, detect shoreline and beach volume changes, landslide risk analysis, habitat mapping, and urban development, among others. A very important application is the classification of the 3D cloud into elementary classes. For example, it can be used to differentiate between vegetation, man-made structures, and water. Our goal is to present a preliminary comparison study for the classification of 3D point cloud LiDAR data that includes several types of feature engineering. In particular, we demonstrate that providing context by augmenting each point in the LiDAR point cloud with information about its neighboring points can improve the performance of downstream learning algorithms. We also experiment with several dimension reduction strategies, ranging from Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to neural network-based auto-encoders, and demonstrate how they affect classification performance in LiDAR point clouds. For instance, we observe that combining feature engineering with a dimension reduction a method such as PCA, there is an improvement in the accuracy of the classification with respect to doing a straightforward classification with the raw data.      
### 68.A two-step explainable approach for COVID-19 computer-aided diagnosis from chest x-ray images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10223.pdf)
>  Early screening of patients is a critical issue in order to assess immediate and fast responses against the spread of COVID-19. The use of nasopharyngeal swabs has been considered the most viable approach; however, the result is not immediate or, in the case of fast exams, sufficiently accurate. Using Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for early screening potentially provides faster and more accurate response; however, diagnosing COVID from CXRs is hard and we should rely on deep learning support, whose decision process is, on the other hand, "black-boxed" and, for such reason, untrustworthy. We propose an explainable two-step diagnostic approach, where we first detect known pathologies (anomalies) in the lungs, on top of which we diagnose the illness. Our approach achieves promising performance in COVID detection, compatible with expert human radiologists. All of our experiments have been carried out bearing in mind that, especially for clinical applications, explainability plays a major role for building trust in machine learning algorithms.      
### 69.Cross-lingual Visual Pre-training for Multimodal Machine Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10044.pdf)
>  Pre-trained language models have been shown to improve performance in many natural language tasks substantially. Although the early focus of such models was single language pre-training, recent advances have resulted in cross-lingual and visual pre-training methods. In this paper, we combine these two approaches to learn visually-grounded cross-lingual representations. Specifically, we extend the translation language modelling (Lample and Conneau, 2019) with masked region classification and perform pre-training with three-way parallel vision &amp; language corpora. We show that when fine-tuned for multimodal machine translation, these models obtain state-of-the-art performance. We also provide qualitative insights into the usefulness of the learned grounded representations.      
### 70.Latent Factor Modeling of Users Subjective Perception for Stereoscopic 3D Video Recommendation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10039.pdf)
>  Numerous stereoscopic 3D movies are released every year to theaters and created large revenues. Despite the improvement in stereo capturing and 3D video post-production technology, stereoscopic artifacts which cause viewer discomfort continue to appear even in high-budget films. Existing automatic 3D video quality measurement tools can detect distortions in stereoscopic images or videos, but they fail to consider the viewer's subjective perception of those artifacts, and how these distortions affect their choices. In this paper, we introduce a novel recommendation system for stereoscopic 3D movies based on a latent factor model that meticulously analyse the viewer's subjective ratings and influence of 3D video distortions on their preferences. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first-of-its-kind model that recommends 3D movies based on stereo-film quality ratings accounting correlation between the viewer's visual discomfort and stereoscopic-artifact perception. The proposed model is trained and tested on benchmark Nama3ds1-cospad1 and LFOVIAS3DPh2 S3D video quality assessment datasets. The experiments revealed that resulting matrix-factorization based recommendation system is able to generalize considerably better for the viewer's subjective ratings.      
### 71.Embedding-based Instance Segmentation of Microscopy Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10033.pdf)
>  Automatic detection and segmentation of objects in microscopy images is important for many biological applications. In the domain of natural images, and in particular in the context of city street scenes, embedding-based instance segmentation leads to high-quality results. Inspired by this line of work, we introduce EmbedSeg, an end-to-end trainable deep learning method based on the work by Neven et al. While their approach embeds each pixel to the centroid of any given instance, in EmbedSeg, motivated by the complex shapes of biological objects, we propose to use the medoid instead. Additionally, we make use of a test-time augmentation scheme, and show that both suggested modifications improve the instance segmentation performance on biological microscopy datasets notably. We demonstrate that embedding-based instance segmentation achieves competitive results in comparison to state-of-the-art methods on diverse and biologically relevant microscopy datasets. Finally, we show that the overall pipeline has a small enough memory footprint to be used on virtually all CUDA enabled laptop hardware. Our open-source implementation is available at <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://github.com/juglab/EmbedSeg" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a>.      
### 72.Understanding and Achieving Efficient Robustness with Adversarial Contrastive Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10027.pdf)
>  Contrastive learning (CL) has recently emerged as an effective approach to learning representation in a range of downstream tasks. Central to this approach is the selection of positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) sets to provide the model the opportunity to `contrast' between data and class representation in the latent space. In this paper, we investigate CL for improving model robustness using adversarial samples. We first designed and performed a comprehensive study to understand how adversarial vulnerability behaves in the latent space. Based on these empirical evidences, we propose an effective and efficient supervised contrastive learning to achieve model robustness against adversarial attacks. Moreover, we propose a new sample selection strategy that optimizes the positive/negative sets by removing redundancy and improving correlation with the anchor. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets show that our Adversarial Supervised Contrastive Learning (ASCL) approach outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses by $2.6\%$ in terms of the robust accuracy, whilst our ASCL with the proposed selection strategy can further gain $1.4\%$ improvement with only $42.8\%$ positives and $6.3\%$ negatives compared with ASCL without a selection strategy.      
### 73.AdderNet and its Minimalist Hardware Design for Energy-Efficient Artificial Intelligence  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10015.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been widely used for boosting the performance of many machine intelligence tasks. However, the CNN models are usually computationally intensive and energy consuming, since they are often designed with numerous multiply-operations and considerable parameters for the accuracy reason. Thus, it is difficult to directly apply them in the resource-constrained environments such as 'Internet of Things' (IoT) devices and smart phones. To reduce the computational complexity and energy burden, here we present a novel minimalist hardware architecture using adder convolutional neural network (AdderNet), in which the original convolution is replaced by adder kernel using only additions. To maximally excavate the potential energy consumption, we explore the low-bit quantization algorithm for AdderNet with shared-scaling-factor method, and we design both specific and general-purpose hardware accelerators for AdderNet. Experimental results show that the adder kernel with int8/int16 quantization also exhibits high performance, meanwhile consuming much less resources (theoretically ~81% off). In addition, we deploy the quantized AdderNet on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) platform. The whole AdderNet can practically achieve 16% enhancement in speed, 67.6%-71.4% decrease in logic resource utilization and 47.85%-77.9% decrease in power consumption compared to CNN under the same circuit architecture. With a comprehensive comparison on the performance, power consumption, hardware resource consumption and network generalization capability, we conclude the AdderNet is able to surpass all the other competitors including the classical CNN, novel memristor-network, XNOR-Net and the shift-kernel based network, indicating its great potential in future high performance and energy-efficient artificial intelligence applications.      
### 74.Automatic Liver Segmentation from CT Images Using Deep Learning Algorithms: A Comparative Study  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09987.pdf)
>  Medical imaging has been employed to support medical diagnosis and treatment. It may also provide crucial information to surgeons to facilitate optimal surgical preplanning and perioperative management. Essentially, semi-automatic organ and tumor segmentation has been studied by many researchers. Recently, with the development of Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, automatic organ segmentation has been gathered lots of attention from the researchers. This paper addresses to propose the most efficient DL architectures for Liver segmentation by adapting and comparing state-of-the-art DL frameworks, studied in different disciplines. These frameworks are implemented and adapted into a Commercial software, 'LiverVision'. It is aimed to reveal the most effective and accurate DL architecture for fully automatic liver segmentation. Equal conditions were provided to all architectures in the experiments so as to measure the effectiveness of algorithms accuracy, and Dice coefficient metrics were also employed to support comparative analysis. Experimental results prove that 'U-Net' and 'SegNet' have been superior in line with the experiments conducted considering the concepts of time, cost, and effectiveness. Considering both architectures, 'SegNet' was observed to be more successful in eliminating false-positive values. Besides, it was seen that the accuracy metric used to measure effectiveness in image segmentation alone was not enough. Results reveal that DL algorithms are able to automate organ segmentation from DICOM images with high accuracy. This contribution is critical for surgical preplanning and motivates author to apply this approach to the different organs and field of medicine.      
### 75.3D U-Net for segmentation of COVID-19 associated pulmonary infiltrates using transfer learning: State-of-the-art results on affordable hardware  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09976.pdf)
>  Segmentation of pulmonary infiltrates can help assess severity of COVID-19, but manual segmentation is labor and time-intensive. Using neural networks to segment pulmonary infiltrates would enable automation of this task. However, training a 3D U-Net from computed tomography (CT) data is time- and resource-intensive. In this work, we therefore developed and tested a solution on how transfer learning can be used to train state-of-the-art segmentation models on limited hardware and in shorter time. We use the recently published RSNA International COVID-19 Open Radiology Database (RICORD) to train a fully three-dimensional U-Net architecture using an 18-layer 3D ResNet, pretrained on the Kinetics-400 dataset as encoder. The generalization of the model was then tested on two openly available datasets of patients with COVID-19, who received chest CTs (Corona Cases and MosMed datasets). Our model performed comparable to previously published 3D U-Net architectures, achieving a mean Dice score of 0.679 on the tuning dataset, 0.648 on the Coronacases dataset and 0.405 on the MosMed dataset. Notably, these results were achieved with shorter training time on a single GPU with less memory available than the GPUs used in previous studies.      
### 76.A new approach to extracting coronary arteries and detecting stenosis in invasive coronary angiograms  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09848.pdf)
>  In stable coronary artery disease (CAD), reduction in mortality and/or myocardial infarction with revascularization over medical therapy has not been reliably achieved. Coronary arteries are usually extracted to perform stenosis detection. We aim to develop an automatic algorithm by deep learning to extract coronary arteries from <a class="link-external link-http" href="http://ICAs.In" rel="external noopener nofollow">this http URL</a> this study, a multi-input and multi-scale (MIMS) U-Net with a two-stage recurrent training strategy was proposed for the automatic vessel segmentation. Incorporating features such as the Inception residual module with depth-wise separable convolutional layers, the proposed model generated a refined prediction map with the following two training stages: (i) Stage I coarsely segmented the major coronary arteries from pre-processed single-channel ICAs and generated the probability map of vessels; (ii) during the Stage II, a three-channel image consisting of the original preprocessed image, a generated probability map, and an edge-enhanced image generated from the preprocessed image was fed to the proposed MIMS U-Net to produce the final segmentation probability map. During the training stage, the probability maps were iteratively and recurrently updated by feeding into the neural network. After segmentation, an arterial stenosis detection algorithm was developed to extract vascular centerlines and calculate arterial diameters to evaluate stenotic level. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved an average Dice score of 0.8329, an average sensitivity of 0.8281, and an average specificity of 0.9979 in our dataset with 294 ICAs obtained from 73 patient. Moreover, our stenosis detection algorithm achieved a true positive rate of 0.6668 and a positive predictive value of 0.7043.      
### 77.Improving Few-Shot Learning with Auxiliary Self-Supervised Pretext Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09825.pdf)
>  Recent work on few-shot learning \cite{tian2020rethinking} showed that quality of learned representations plays an important role in few-shot classification performance. On the other hand, the goal of self-supervised learning is to recover useful semantic information of the data without the use of class labels. In this work, we exploit the complementarity of both paradigms via a multi-task framework where we leverage recent self-supervised methods as auxiliary tasks. We found that combining multiple tasks is often beneficial, and that solving them simultaneously can be done efficiently. Our results suggest that self-supervised auxiliary tasks are effective data-dependent regularizers for representation learning.

### 78.Meta-Regularization by Enforcing Mutual-Exclusiveness  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09819.pdf)
>  Meta-learning models have two objectives. First, they need to be able to make predictions over a range of task distributions while utilizing only a small amount of training data. Second, they also need to adapt to new novel unseen tasks at meta-test time again by using only a small amount of training data from that task. It is the second objective where meta-learning models fail for non-mutually exclusive tasks due to task overfitting. Given that guaranteeing mutually exclusive tasks is often difficult, there is a significant need for regularization methods that can help reduce the impact of task-memorization in meta-learning. For example, in the case of N-way, K-shot classification problems, tasks becomes non-mutually exclusive when the labels associated with each task is fixed. Under this design, the model will simply memorize the class labels of all the training tasks, and thus will fail to recognize a new task (class) at meta-test time. A direct observable consequence of this memorization is that the meta-learning model simply ignores the task-specific training data in favor of directly classifying based on the test-data input. In our work, we propose a regularization technique for meta-learning models that gives the model designer more control over the information flow during meta-training. Our method consists of a regularization function that is constructed by maximizing the distance between task-summary statistics, in the case of black-box models and task specific network parameters in the case of optimization based models during meta-training. Our proposed regularization function shows an accuracy boost of $\sim$ $36\%$ on the Omniglot dataset for 5-way, 1-shot classification using black-box method and for 20-way, 1-shot classification problem using optimization-based method.      
### 79.AQuA: Analytical Quality Assessment for Optimizing Video Analytics Systems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09752.pdf)
>  Millions of cameras at edge are being deployed to power a variety of different deep learning applications. However, the frames captured by these cameras are not always pristine - they can be distorted due to lighting issues, sensor noise, compression etc. Such distortions not only deteriorate visual quality, they impact the accuracy of deep learning applications that process such video streams. In this work, we introduce AQuA, to protect application accuracy against such distorted frames by scoring the level of distortion in the frames. It takes into account the analytical quality of frames, not the visual quality, by learning a novel metric, classifier opinion score, and uses a lightweight, CNN-based, object-independent feature extractor. AQuA accurately scores distortion levels of frames and generalizes to multiple different deep learning applications. When used for filtering poor quality frames at edge, it reduces high-confidence errors for analytics applications by 17%. Through filtering, and due to its low overhead (14ms), AQuA can also reduce computation time and average bandwidth usage by 25%.      
### 80.Fast Sequence Generation with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09698.pdf)
>  Autoregressive sequence Generation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in areas like machine translation and image captioning. These models are autoregressive in that they generate each word by conditioning on previously generated words, which leads to heavy latency during inference. Recently, non-autoregressive decoding has been proposed in machine translation to speed up the inference time by generating all words in parallel. Typically, these models use the word-level cross-entropy loss to optimize each word independently. However, such a learning process fails to consider the sentence-level consistency, thus resulting in inferior generation quality of these non-autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient model for Non-Autoregressive sequence Generation (NAG) with a novel training paradigm: Counterfactuals-critical Multi-Agent Learning (CMAL). CMAL formulates NAG as a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where element positions in the target sequence are viewed as agents that learn to cooperatively maximize a sentence-level reward. On MSCOCO image captioning benchmark, our NAG method achieves a performance comparable to state-of-the-art autoregressive models, while brings 13.9x decoding speedup. On WMT14 EN-DE machine translation dataset, our method outperforms cross-entropy trained baseline by 6.0 BLEU points while achieves the greatest decoding speedup of 17.46x.      
### 81.Stochastic Image Denoising by Sampling from the Posterior Distribution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09552.pdf)
>  Image denoising is a well-known and well studied problem, commonly targeting a minimization of the mean squared error (MSE) between the outcome and the original image. Unfortunately, especially for severe noise levels, such Minimum MSE (MMSE) solutions may lead to blurry output images. In this work we propose a novel stochastic denoising approach that produces viable and high perceptual quality results, while maintaining a small MSE. Our method employs Langevin dynamics that relies on a repeated application of any given MMSE denoiser, obtaining the reconstructed image by effectively sampling from the posterior distribution. Due to its stochasticity, the proposed algorithm can produce a variety of high-quality outputs for a given noisy input, all shown to be legitimate denoising results. In addition, we present an extension of our algorithm for handling the inpainting problem, recovering missing pixels and removing noise from partially given noisy data.      
### 82.Hierarchical Domain Invariant Variational Auto-Encoding with weak domain supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09436.pdf)
>  We address the task of domain generalization, where the goal is to train a predictive model based on a number of domains such that it is able to generalize to a new, previously unseen domain. We choose a generative approach within the framework of variational autoencoders and propose a weakly supervised algorithm that is able to account for incomplete and hierarchical domain information. We show that our method is able to learn representations that disentangle domain-specific information from class-label specific information even in complex settings where an unobserved substructure is present in domains. Our interpretable method outperforms previously proposed generative algorithms for domain generalization and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, which are based on complex image-processing steps, on the standard domain generalization benchmark dataset PACS.      
### 83.Adaptively Sparse Regularization for Blind Image Restoration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09401.pdf)
>  Image quality is the basis of image communication and understanding tasks. Due to the blur and noise effects caused by imaging, transmission and other processes, the image quality is degraded. Blind image restoration is widely used to improve image quality, where the main goal is to faithfully estimate the blur kernel and the latent sharp image. In this study, based on experimental observation and research, an adaptively sparse regularized minimization method is originally proposed. The high-order gradients combine with low-order ones to form a hybrid regularization term, and an adaptive operator derived from the image entropy is introduced to maintain a good convergence. Extensive experiments were conducted on different blur kernels and images. Compared with existing state-of-the-art blind deblurring methods, our method demonstrates superiority on the recovery accuracy.
