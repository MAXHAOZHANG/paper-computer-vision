### 1.Interpretability of a Deep Learning Model in the Application of Cardiac MRI Segmentation with an ACDC Challenge Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08590.pdf)
>  Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) is the most effective tool for the assessment and diagnosis of a heart condition, which malfunction is the world's leading cause of death. Software tools leveraging Artificial Intelligence already enhance radiologists and cardiologists in heart condition assessment but their lack of transparency is a problem. This project investigates if it is possible to discover concepts representative for different cardiac conditions from the deep network trained to segment crdiac structures: Left Ventricle (LV), Right Ventricle (RV) and Myocardium (MYO), using explainability methods that enhances classification system by providing the score-based values of qualitative concepts, along with the key performance metrics. With introduction of a need of explanations in GDPR explainability of AI systems is necessary. This study applies Discovering and Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (D-TCAV), an interpretaibilty method to extract underlying features important for cardiac disease diagnosis from MRI data. The method provides a quantitative notion of concept importance for disease classified. In previous studies, the base method is applied to the classification of cardiac disease and provides clinically meaningful explanations for the predictions of a black-box deep learning classifier. This study applies a method extending TCAV with a Discovering phase (D-TCAV) to cardiac MRI analysis. The advantage of the D-TCAV method over the base method is that it is user-independent. The contribution of this study is a novel application of the explainability method D-TCAV for cardiac MRI anlysis. D-TCAV provides a shorter pre-processing time for clinicians than the base method.      
### 2.RoRD: Rotation-Robust Descriptors and Orthographic Views for Local Feature Matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08573.pdf)
>  The use of local detectors and descriptors in typical computer vision pipelines work well until variations in viewpoint and appearance change become extreme. Past research in this area has typically focused on one of two approaches to this challenge: the use of projections into spaces more suitable for feature matching under extreme viewpoint changes, and attempting to learn features that are inherently more robust to viewpoint change. In this paper, we present a novel framework that combines learning of invariant descriptors through data augmentation and orthographic viewpoint projection. We propose rotation-robust local descriptors, learnt through training data augmentation based on rotation homographies, and a correspondence ensemble technique that combines vanilla feature correspondences with those obtained through rotation-robust features. Using a range of benchmark datasets as well as contributing a new bespoke dataset for this research domain, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on key tasks including pose estimation and visual place recognition. Our system outperforms a range of baseline and state-of-the-art techniques, including enabling higher levels of place recognition precision across opposing place viewpoints and achieves practically-useful performance levels even under extreme viewpoint changes.      
### 3.Is Medical Chest X-ray Data Anonymous?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08562.pdf)
>  With the rise and ever-increasing potential of deep learning techniques in recent years, publicly available medical data sets became a key factor to enable reproducible development of diagnostic algorithms in the medical domain. Medical data contains sensitive patient-related information and is therefore usually anonymized by removing patient identifiers, e.g., patient names before publication. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that a well-trained deep learning system is able to recover the patient identity from chest X-ray data. We demonstrate this using the publicly available large-scale ChestX-ray14 dataset, a collection of 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. Our verification system is able to identify whether two frontal chest X-ray images are from the same person with an AUC of 0.9940 and a classification accuracy of 95.55%. We further highlight that the proposed system is able to reveal the same person even ten and more years after the initial scan. When pursuing a retrieval approach, we observe an mAP@R of 0.9748 and a precision@1 of 0.9963. Based on this high identification rate, a potential attacker may leak patient-related information and additionally cross-reference images to obtain more information. Thus, there is a great risk of sensitive content falling into unauthorized hands or being disseminated against the will of the concerned patients. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous chest X-ray datasets have been published to advance research. Therefore, such data may be vulnerable to potential attacks by deep learning-based re-identification algorithms.      
### 4.Multiclass Anomaly Detection in GI Endoscopic Images using Optimized Deep One-class Classification in an Imbalanced Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08508.pdf)
>  Wireless Capsule Endoscopy helps physicians examine the gastrointestinal (GI) tract noninvasively, with the cost of generating many images. Many available datasets, such as KID2 and Kvasir, suffer from imbalance issue which make it difficult to train an effective artificial intelligence (AI) system. Moreover, increasing number of classes makes the problem worse. In this study, an ensemble of one-class classifiers is used for detecting anomaly. This method focuses on learning single models using samples from only one class, and ensemble all models for multiclass classification. A total of 1,778 normal, 227 inflammation, 303 vascular diseases, and 44 polyp images have been used from the KID2 dataset. In the first step, deep features are extracted based on an autoencoder architecture from the preprocessed images. Then, these features are oversampled using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and clustered using Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure. To create one-class classification model, the Support Vector Data Descriptions are trained on each cluster with the help of Ant Colony Optimization, which is also used for tuning clustering parameters for improving F1-score. This process is applied on each classes and ensemble of final models used for multiclass classification. The entire algorithm ran 5 times and obtained F1-score 96.3 +- 0.2% and macro-average F1-score 85.0 +- 0.4%, for anomaly detection and multiclass classification, respectively. The results are compared with GoogleNet, AlexNet, Resnet50, VGG16 and other published algorithms, and demonstrate that the proposed method is a competitive choice for multiclass class anomaly detection in GI images.      
### 5.Siamese Network Features for Endoscopy Image and Video Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08504.pdf)
>  Conventional Endoscopy (CE) and Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) are known tools for diagnosing gastrointestinal (GI) tract disorders. Localizing frames provide valuable information about the anomaly location and also can help clinicians determine a more appropriate treatment plan. There are many automated algorithms to detect the anomaly. However, very few of the existing works address the issue of localization. In this study, we present a combination of meta-learning and deep learning for localizing both endoscopy images and video. A dataset is collected from 10 different anatomical positions of human GI tract. In the meta-learning section, the system was trained using 78 CE and 27 WCE annotated frames with a modified Siamese Neural Network (SNN) to predict the location of one single image/frame. Then, a postprocessing section using bidirectional long short-term memory is proposed for localizing a sequence of frames. Here, we have employed feature vector, distance and predicted location obtained from a trained SNN. The postprocessing section is trained and tested on 1,028 and 365 seconds of CE and WCE videos using hold-out validation (50%), and achieved F1-score of 86.3% and 83.0%, respectively. In addition, we performed subjective evaluation using nine gastroenterologists. The results show that the computer-aided methods can outperform gastroenterologists assessment of localization. The proposed method is compared with various approaches, such as support vector machine with hand-crafted features, convolutional neural network and the transfer learning-based methods, and showed better results. Therefore, it can be used in frame localization, which can help in video summarization and anomaly detection.      
### 6.Uncertainty-Based Biological Age Estimation of Brain MRI Scans  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08491.pdf)
>  Age is an essential factor in modern diagnostic procedures. However, assessment of the true biological age (BA) remains a daunting task due to the lack of reference ground-truth labels. Current BA estimation approaches are either restricted to skeletal images or rely on non-imaging modalities that yield a whole-body BA assessment. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. In this initial study, we propose a new framework for organ-specific BA estimation utilizing 3D magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans. As a first step, this framework predicts the chronological age (CA) together with the corresponding patient-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. An iterative training algorithm is then utilized to segregate atypical aging patients from the given population based on the predicted uncertainty scores. In this manner, we hypothesize that training a new model on the remaining population should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the proposed methodology on a brain MRI dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients.      
### 7.Machine Learning for Nondestructive Wear Assessment in Large Internal Combustion Engines  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08482.pdf)
>  Digitalization offers a large number of promising tools for large internal combustion engines such as condition monitoring or condition-based maintenance. This includes the status evaluation of key engine components such as cylinder liners, whose inner surfaces are subject to constant wear due to their movement relative to the pistons. Existing state-of-the-art methods for quantifying wear require disassembly and cutting of the examined liner followed by a high-resolution microscopic surface depth measurement that quantitatively evaluates wear based on bearing load curves (also known as Abbott-Firestone curves). Such reference methods are destructive, time-consuming and costly. The goal of the research presented here is to develop simpler and nondestructive yet reliable and meaningful methods for evaluating wear condition. A deep-learning framework is proposed that allows computation of the surface-representing bearing load curves from reflection RGB images of the liner surface that can be collected with a simple handheld device, without the need to remove and destroy the investigated liner. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network is trained to estimate the bearing load curve of the corresponding depth profile, which in turn can be used for further wear evaluation. Training of the network is performed using a custom-built database containing depth profiles and reflection images of liner surfaces of large gas engines. The results of the proposed method are visually examined and quantified considering several probabilistic distance metrics and comparison of roughness indicators between ground truth and model predictions. The observed success of the proposed method suggests its great potential for quantitative wear assessment on engines and service directly on site.      
### 8.Deep Consensus Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08475.pdf)
>  Both generative learning and discriminative learning have recently witnessed remarkable progress using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). For structured input synthesis and structured output prediction problems (e.g., layout-to-image synthesis and image semantic segmentation respectively), they often are studied separately. This paper proposes deep consensus learning (DCL) for joint layout-to-image synthesis and weakly-supervised image semantic segmentation. The former is realized by a recently proposed LostGAN approach, and the latter by introducing an inference network as the third player joining the two-player game of LostGAN. Two deep consensus mappings are exploited to facilitate training the three networks end-to-end: Given an input layout (a list of object bounding boxes), the generator generates a mask (label map) and then use it to help synthesize an image. The inference network infers the mask for the synthesized image. Then, the latent consensus is measured between the mask generated by the generator and the one inferred by the inference network. For the real image corresponding to the input layout, its mask also is computed by the inference network, and then used by the generator to reconstruct the real image. Then, the data consensus is measured between the real image and its reconstructed image. The discriminator still plays the role of an adversary by computing the realness scores for a real image, its reconstructed image and a synthesized image. In experiments, our DCL is tested in the COCO-Stuff dataset. It obtains compelling layout-to-image synthesis results and weakly-supervised image semantic segmentation results.      
### 9.Beyond Image to Depth: Improving Depth Prediction using Echoes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08468.pdf)
>  We address the problem of estimating depth with multi modal audio visual data. Inspired by the ability of animals, such as bats and dolphins, to infer distance of objects with echolocation, some recent methods have utilized echoes for depth estimation. We propose an end-to-end deep learning based pipeline utilizing RGB images, binaural echoes and estimated material properties of various objects within a scene. We argue that the relation between image, echoes and depth, for different scene elements, is greatly influenced by the properties of those elements, and a method designed to leverage this information can lead to significantly improve depth estimation from audio visual inputs. We propose a novel multi modal fusion technique, which incorporates the material properties explicitly while combining audio (echoes) and visual modalities to predict the scene depth. We show empirically, with experiments on Replica dataset, that the proposed method obtains 28% improvement in RMSE compared to the state-of-the-art audio-visual depth prediction method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on larger dataset, we report competitive performance on Matterport3D, proposing to use it as a multimodal depth prediction benchmark with echoes for the first time. We also analyse the proposed method with exhaustive ablation experiments and qualitative results.

### 10.RANP: Resource Aware Neuron Pruning at Initialization for 3D CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08457.pdf)
>  Although 3D Convolutional Neural Networks are essential for most learning based applications involving dense 3D data, their applicability is limited due to excessive memory and computational requirements. Compressing such networks by pruning therefore becomes highly desirable. However, pruning 3D CNNs is largely unexplored possibly because of the complex nature of typical pruning algorithms that embeds pruning into an iterative optimization paradigm. In this work, we introduce a Resource Aware Neuron Pruning (RANP) algorithm that prunes 3D CNNs at initialization to high sparsity levels. Specifically, the core idea is to obtain an importance score for each neuron based on their sensitivity to the loss function. This neuron importance is then reweighted according to the neuron resource consumption related to FLOPs or memory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pruning method on 3D semantic segmentation with widely used 3D-UNets on ShapeNet and BraTS'18 datasets, video classification with MobileNetV2 and I3D on UCF101 dataset, and two-view stereo matching with Pyramid Stereo Matching (PSM) network on SceneFlow dataset. In these experiments, our RANP leads to roughly 50%-95% reduction in FLOPs and 35%-80% reduction in memory with negligible loss in accuracy compared to the unpruned networks. This significantly reduces the computational resources required to train 3D CNNs. The pruned network obtained by our algorithm can also be easily scaled up and transferred to another dataset for training.      
### 11.Margin Preserving Self-paced Contrastive Learning Towards Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08454.pdf)
>  To bridge the gap between the source and target domains in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), the most common strategy puts focus on matching the marginal distributions in the feature space through adversarial learning. However, such category-agnostic global alignment lacks of exploiting the class-level joint distributions, causing the aligned distribution less discriminative. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel margin preserving self-paced contrastive Learning (MPSCL) model for cross-modal medical image segmentation. Unlike the conventional construction of contrastive pairs in contrastive learning, the domain-adaptive category prototypes are utilized to constitute the positive and negative sample pairs. With the guidance of progressively refined semantic prototypes, a novel margin preserving contrastive loss is proposed to boost the discriminability of embedded representation space. To enhance the supervision for contrastive learning, more informative pseudo-labels are generated in target domain in a self-paced way, thus benefiting the category-aware distribution alignment for UDA. Furthermore, the domain-invariant representations are learned through joint contrastive learning between the two domains. Extensive experiments on cross-modal cardiac segmentation tasks demonstrate that MPSCL significantly improves semantic segmentation performance, and outperforms a wide variety of state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.      
### 12.S-AT GCN: Spatial-Attention Graph Convolution Network based Feature Enhancement for 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08439.pdf)
>  3D object detection plays a crucial role in environmental perception for autonomous vehicles, which is the prerequisite of decision and control. This paper analyses partition-based methods' inherent drawbacks. In the partition operation, a single instance such as a pedestrian is sliced into several pieces, which we call it the partition effect. We propose the Spatial-Attention Graph Convolution (S-AT GCN), forming the Feature Enhancement (FE) layers to overcome this drawback. The S-AT GCN utilizes the graph convolution and the spatial attention mechanism to extract local geometrical structure features. This allows the network to have more meaningful features for the foreground. Our experiments on the KITTI 3D object and bird's eye view detection show that S-AT Conv and FE layers are effective, especially for small objects. FE layers boost the pedestrian class performance by 3.62\% and cyclist class by 4.21\% 3D mAP. The time cost of these extra FE layers are limited. PointPillars with FE layers can achieve 48 PFS, satisfying the real-time requirement.      
### 13.Metric Learning for Anti-Compression Facial Forgery Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08397.pdf)
>  Detecting facial forgery images and videos is an increasingly important topic in multimedia forensics. As forgery images and videos are usually compressed to different formats such as JPEG and H264 when circulating on the Internet, existing forgery-detection methods trained on uncompressed data often have significantly decreased performance in identifying them. To solve this problem, we propose a novel anti-compression facial forgery detection framework, which learns a compression-insensitive embedding feature space utilizing both original and compressed forgeries. Specifically, our approach consists of two novel ideas: (i) extracting compression-insensitive features from both uncompressed and compressed forgeries using an adversarial learning strategy; (ii) learning a robust partition by constructing a metric loss that can reduce the distance of the paired original and compressed images in the embedding space. Experimental results demonstrate that, the proposed method is highly effective in handling both compressed and uncompressed facial forgery images.      
### 14.Beyond ANN: Exploiting Structural Knowledge for Efficient Place Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08366.pdf)
>  Visual place recognition is the task of recognizing same places of query images in a set of database images, despite potential condition changes due to time of day, weather or seasons. It is important for loop closure detection in SLAM and candidate selection for global localization. Many approaches in the literature perform computationally inefficient full image comparisons between queries and all database images. There is still a lack of suited methods for efficient place recognition that allow a fast, sparse comparison of only the most promising image pairs without any loss in performance. While this is partially given by ANN-based methods, they trade speed for precision and additional memory consumption, and many cannot find arbitrary numbers of matching database images in case of loops in the database. In this paper, we propose a novel fast sequence-based method for efficient place recognition that can be applied online. It uses relocalization to recover from sequence losses, and exploits usually available but often unused intra-database similarities for a potential detection of all matching database images for each query in case of loops or stops in the database. We performed extensive experimental evaluations over five datasets and 21 sequence combinations, and show that our method outperforms two state-of-the-art approaches and even full image comparisons in many cases, while providing a good tradeoff between performance and percentage of evaluated image pairs. Source code for Matlab will be provided with publication of this paper.      
### 15.Knowledge driven Description Synthesis for Floor Plan Interpretation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08298.pdf)
>  Image captioning is a widely known problem in the area of AI. Caption generation from floor plan images has applications in indoor path planning, real estate, and providing architectural solutions. Several methods have been explored in literature for generating captions or semi-structured descriptions from floor plan images. Since only the caption is insufficient to capture fine-grained details, researchers also proposed descriptive paragraphs from images. However, these descriptions have a rigid structure and lack flexibility, making it difficult to use them in real-time scenarios. This paper offers two models, Description Synthesis from Image Cue (DSIC) and Transformer Based Description Generation (TBDG), for the floor plan image to text generation to fill the gaps in existing methods. These two models take advantage of modern deep neural networks for visual feature extraction and text generation. The difference between both models is in the way they take input from the floor plan image. The DSIC model takes only visual features automatically extracted by a deep neural network, while the TBDG model learns textual captions extracted from input floor plan images with paragraphs. The specific keywords generated in TBDG and understanding them with paragraphs make it more robust in a general floor plan image. Experiments were carried out on a large-scale publicly available dataset and compared with state-of-the-art techniques to show the proposed model's superiority.      
### 16.GRIHA: Synthesizing 2-Dimensional Building Layouts from Images Captured using a Smart Phone  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08297.pdf)
>  Reconstructing an indoor scene and generating a layout/floor plan in 3D or 2D is a widely known problem. Quite a few algorithms have been proposed in the literature recently. However, most existing methods either use RGB-D images, thus requiring a depth camera, or depending on panoramic photos, assuming that there is little to no occlusion in the rooms. In this work, we proposed GRIHA (Generating Room Interior of a House using ARCore), a framework for generating a layout using an RGB image captured using a simple mobile phone camera. We take advantage of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to assess the 3D transformations required for layout generation. SLAM technology is built-in in recent mobile libraries such as ARCore by Google. Hence, the proposed method is fast and efficient. It gives the user freedom to generate layout by merely taking a few conventional photos, rather than relying on specialized depth hardware or occlusion-free panoramic images. We have compared GRIHA with other existing methods and obtained superior results. Also, the system is tested on multiple hardware platforms to test the dependency and efficiency.      
### 17.3D-FFS: Faster 3D object detection with Focused Frustum Search in sensor fusion based networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08294.pdf)
>  In this work we propose 3D-FFS, a novel approach to make sensor fusion based 3D object detection networks significantly faster using a class of computationally inexpensive heuristics. Existing sensor fusion based networks generate 3D region proposals by leveraging inferences from 2D object detectors. However, as images have no depth information, these networks rely on extracting semantic features of points from the entire scene to locate the object. By leveraging aggregated intrinsic properties (e.g. point density) of the 3D point cloud data, 3D-FFS can substantially constrain the 3D search space and thereby significantly reduce training time, inference time and memory consumption without sacrificing accuracy. To demonstrate the efficacy of 3D-FFS, we have integrated it with Frustum ConvNet (F-ConvNet), a prominent sensor fusion based 3D object detection model. We assess the performance of 3D-FFS on the KITTI dataset. Compared to F-ConvNet, we achieve improvements in training and inference times by up to 62.84% and 56.46%, respectively, while reducing the memory usage by up to 58.53%. Additionally, we achieve 0.59%, 2.03% and 3.34% improvements in accuracy for the Car, Pedestrian and Cyclist classes, respectively. 3D-FFS shows a lot of promise in domains with limited computing power, such as autonomous vehicles, drones and robotics where LiDAR-Camera based sensor fusion perception systems are widely used.      
### 18.Rotation Coordinate Descent for Fast Globally Optimal Rotation Averaging  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08292.pdf)
>  Under mild conditions on the noise level of the measurements, rotation averaging satisfies strong duality, which enables global solutions to be obtained via semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation. However, generic solvers for SDP are rather slow in practice, even on rotation averaging instances of moderate size, thus developing specialised algorithms is vital. In this paper, we present a fast algorithm that achieves global optimality called rotation coordinate descent (RCD). Unlike block coordinate descent (BCD) which solves SDP by updating the semidefinite matrix in a row-by-row fashion, RCD directly maintains and updates all valid rotations throughout the iterations. This obviates the need to store a large dense semidefinite matrix. We mathematically prove the convergence of our algorithm and empirically show its superior efficiency over state-of-the-art global methods on a variety of problem configurations. Maintaining valid rotations also facilitates incorporating local optimisation routines for further speed-ups. Moreover, our algorithm is simple to implement; see supplementary material for a demonstration program.      
### 19.DeepOPG: Improving Orthopantomogram Finding Summarization with Weak Supervision  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08290.pdf)
>  Finding summaries from an orthopantomogram, or a dental panoramic radiograph, has significant potential to improve patient communication and to speed up clinical judgments. While orthopantomogram is a first-line tool for dental examinations, no existing work has explored the summarization of findings from it. A finding summary has to not only find teeth in the imaging study but also label the teeth with several types of treatments. To tackle the problem, we develop DeepOPG that breaks the summarization process into functional segmentation and teeth localization, the latter of which is further refined by a novel dental coherence module. We also leverage weak supervision labels to improve detection results in a reinforcement learning scenario. Experiments show high efficacy of DeepOPG on finding summarization, achieving an overall AUC of 88.2% in detecting six types of findings. The proposed dental coherence and weak supervision both are shown to improve DeepOPG by adding 5.9% and 0.4% to AP@IoU=0.5 respectively.      
### 20.Trust Your IMU: Consequences of Ignoring the IMU Drift  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08286.pdf)
>  In this paper, we argue that modern pre-integration methods for inertial measurement units (IMUs) are accurate enough to ignore the drift for short time intervals. This allows us to consider a simplified camera model, which in turn admits further intrinsic calibration. We develop the first-ever solver to jointly solve the relative pose problem with unknown and equal focal length and radial distortion profile while utilizing the IMU data. Furthermore, we show significant speed-up compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, with small or negligible loss in accuracy for partially calibrated setups. The proposed algorithms are tested on both synthetic and real data, where the latter is focused on navigation using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We evaluate the proposed solvers on different commercially available low-cost UAVs, and demonstrate that the novel assumption on IMU drift is feasible in real-life applications. The extended intrinsic auto-calibration enables us to use distorted input images, making tedious calibration processes obsolete, compared to current state-of-the-art methods.      
### 21.Refine Myself by Teaching Myself: Feature Refinement via Self-Knowledge Distillation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08273.pdf)
>  Knowledge distillation is a method of transferring the knowledge from a pretrained complex teacher model to a student model, so a smaller network can replace a large teacher network at the deployment stage. To reduce the necessity of training a large teacher model, the recent literatures introduced a self-knowledge distillation, which trains a student network progressively to distill its own knowledge without a pretrained teacher network. While Self-knowledge distillation is largely divided into a data augmentation based approach and an auxiliary network based approach, the data augmentation approach looses its local information in the augmentation process, which hinders its applicability to diverse vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation. Moreover, these knowledge distillation approaches do not receive the refined feature maps, which are prevalent in the object detection and semantic segmentation community. This paper proposes a novel self-knowledge distillation method, Feature Refinement via Self-Knowledge Distillation (FRSKD), which utilizes an auxiliary self-teacher network to transfer a refined knowledge for the classifier network. Our proposed method, FRSKD, can utilize both soft label and feature-map distillations for the self-knowledge distillation. Therefore, FRSKD can be applied to classification, and semantic segmentation, which emphasize preserving the local information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FRSKD by enumerating its performance improvements in diverse tasks and benchmark datasets.

### 22.Learning Compositional Representation for 4D Captures with Neural ODE  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08271.pdf)
>  Learning based representation has become the key to the success of many computer vision systems. While many 3D representations have been proposed, it is still an unaddressed problem for how to represent a dynamically changing 3D object. In this paper, we introduce a compositional representation for 4D captures, i.e. a deforming 3D object over a temporal span, that disentangles shape, initial state, and motion respectively. Each component is represented by a latent code via a trained encoder. To model the motion, a neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is trained to update the initial state conditioned on the learned motion code, and a decoder takes the shape code and the updated pose code to reconstruct 4D captures at each time stamp. To this end, we propose an Identity Exchange Training (IET) strategy to encourage the network to learn effectively decoupling each component. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning based methods on 4D reconstruction, and significantly improves on various tasks, including motion transfer and completion.      
### 23.Boosting ship detection in SAR images with complementary pretraining techniques  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08251.pdf)
>  Deep learning methods have made significant progress in ship detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The pretraining technique is usually adopted to support deep neural networks-based SAR ship detectors due to the scarce labeled SAR images. However, directly leveraging ImageNet pretraining is hardly to obtain a good ship detector because of different imaging perspective and geometry. In this paper, to resolve the problem of inconsistent imaging perspective between ImageNet and earth observations, we propose an optical ship detector (OSD) pretraining technique, which transfers the characteristics of ships in earth observations to SAR images from a large-scale aerial image dataset. On the other hand, to handle the problem of different imaging geometry between optical and SAR images, we propose an optical-SAR matching (OSM) pretraining technique, which transfers plentiful texture features from optical images to SAR images by common representation learning on the optical-SAR matching task. Finally, observing that the OSD pretraining based SAR ship detector has a better recall on sea area while the OSM pretraining based SAR ship detector can reduce false alarms on land area, we combine the predictions of the two detectors through weighted boxes fusion to further improve detection results. Extensive experiments on four SAR ship detection datasets and two representative CNN-based detection benchmarks are conducted to show the effectiveness and complementarity of the two proposed detectors, and the state-of-the-art performance of the combination of the two detectors. The proposed method won the sixth place of ship detection in SAR images in 2020 Gaofen challenge.      
### 24.Generating Synthetic Handwritten Historical Documents With OCR Constrained GANs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08236.pdf)
>  We present a framework to generate synthetic historical documents with precise ground truth using nothing more than a collection of unlabeled historical images. Obtaining large labeled datasets is often the limiting factor to effectively use supervised deep learning methods for Document Image Analysis (DIA). Prior approaches towards synthetic data generation either require expertise or result in poor accuracy in the synthetic documents. To achieve high precision transformations without requiring expertise, we tackle the problem in two steps. First, we create template documents with user-specified content and structure. Second, we transfer the style of a collection of unlabeled historical images to these template documents while preserving their text and layout. We evaluate the use of our synthetic historical documents in a pre-training setting and find that we outperform the baselines (randomly initialized and pre-trained). Additionally, with visual examples, we demonstrate a high-quality synthesis that makes it possible to generate large labeled historical document datasets with precise ground truth.      
### 25.Adapt Everywhere: Unsupervised Adaptation of Point-Clouds and Entropy Minimisation for Multi-modal Cardiac Image Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08219.pdf)
>  Deep learning models are sensitive to domain shift phenomena. A model trained on images from one domain cannot generalise well when tested on images from a different domain, despite capturing similar anatomical structures. It is mainly because the data distribution between the two domains is different. Moreover, creating annotation for every new modality is a tedious and time-consuming task, which also suffers from high inter- and intra- observer variability. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods intend to reduce the gap between source and target domains by leveraging source domain labelled data to generate labels for the target domain. However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) UDA methods demonstrate degraded performance when there is insufficient data in source and target domains. In this paper, we present a novel UDA method for multi-modal cardiac image segmentation. The proposed method is based on adversarial learning and adapts network features between source and target domain in different spaces. The paper introduces an end-to-end framework that integrates: a) entropy minimisation, b) output feature space alignment and c) a novel point-cloud shape adaptation based on the latent features learned by the segmentation model. We validated our method on two cardiac datasets by adapting from the annotated source domain, bSSFP-MRI (balanced Steady-State Free Procession-MRI), to the unannotated target domain, LGE-MRI (Late-gadolinium enhance-MRI), for the multi-sequence dataset; and from MRI (source) to CT (target) for the cross-modality dataset. The results highlighted that by enforcing adversarial learning in different parts of the network, the proposed method delivered promising performance, compared to other SOTA methods.      
### 26.Detecting Human-Object Interaction via Fabricated Compositional Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08214.pdf)
>  Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, inferring the relationships between human and objects from images/videos, is a fundamental task for high-level scene understanding. However, HOI detection usually suffers from the open long-tailed nature of interactions with objects, while human has extremely powerful compositional perception ability to cognize rare or unseen HOI samples. Inspired by this, we devise a novel HOI compositional learning framework, termed as Fabricated Compositional Learning (FCL), to address the problem of open long-tailed HOI detection. Specifically, we introduce an object fabricator to generate effective object representations, and then combine verbs and fabricated objects to compose new HOI samples. With the proposed object fabricator, we are able to generate large-scale HOI samples for rare and unseen categories to alleviate the open long-tailed issues in HOI detection. Extensive experiments on the most popular HOI detection dataset, HICO-DET, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for imbalanced HOI detection and significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on rare and unseen HOI categories.

### 27.Cascaded Feature Warping Network for Unsupervised Medical Image Registration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08213.pdf)
>  Deformable image registration is widely utilized in medical image analysis, but most proposed methods fail in the situation of complex deformations. In this paper, we pre-sent a cascaded feature warping network to perform the coarse-to-fine registration. To achieve this, a shared-weights encoder network is adopted to generate the feature pyramids for the unaligned images. The feature warping registration module is then used to estimate the deformation field at each level. The coarse-to-fine manner is implemented by cascading the module from the bottom level to the top level. Furthermore, the multi-scale loss is also introduced to boost the registration performance. We employ two public benchmark datasets and conduct various experiments to evaluate our method. The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which also demonstrates that the cascaded feature warping network can perform the coarse-to-fine registration effectively and efficiently.      
### 28.3DCaricShop: A Dataset and A Baseline Method for Single-view 3D Caricature Face Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08204.pdf)
>  Caricature is an artistic representation that deliberately exaggerates the distinctive features of a human face to convey humor or sarcasm. However, reconstructing a 3D caricature from a 2D caricature image remains a challenging task, mostly due to the lack of data. We propose to fill this gap by introducing 3DCaricShop, the first large-scale 3D caricature dataset that contains 2000 high-quality diversified 3D caricatures manually crafted by professional artists. 3DCaricShop also provides rich annotations including a paired 2D caricature image, camera parameters and 3D facial landmarks. To demonstrate the advantage of 3DCaricShop, we present a novel baseline approach for single-view 3D caricature reconstruction. To ensure a faithful reconstruction with plausible face deformations, we propose to connect the good ends of the detailrich implicit functions and the parametric mesh representations. In particular, we first register a template mesh to the output of the implicit generator and iteratively project the registration result onto a pre-trained PCA space to resolve artifacts and self-intersections. To deal with the large deformation during non-rigid registration, we propose a novel view-collaborative graph convolution network (VCGCN) to extract key points from the implicit mesh for accurate alignment. Our method is able to generate highfidelity 3D caricature in a pre-defined mesh topology that is animation-ready. Extensive experiments have been conducted on 3DCaricShop to verify the significance of the database and the effectiveness of the proposed method.      
### 29.Geometric Change Detection in Digital Twins using 3D Machine Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08201.pdf)
>  Digital twins are meant to bridge the gap between real-world physical systems and virtual representations. Both stand-alone and descriptive digital twins incorporate 3D geometric models, which are the physical representations of objects in the digital replica. Digital twin applications are required to rapidly update internal parameters with the evolution of their physical counterpart. Due to an essential need for having high-quality geometric models for accurate physical representations, the storage and bandwidth requirements for storing 3D model information can quickly exceed the available storage and bandwidth capacity. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to geometric change detection in the context of a digital twin. We address the issue through a combined solution of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for motion detection, YOLOv5 for object detection, and 3D machine learning for pose estimation. DMD is applied for background subtraction, enabling detection of moving foreground objects in real-time. The video frames containing detected motion are extracted and used as input to the change detection network. The object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is applied to extract the bounding boxes of detected objects in the video frames. Furthermore, the rotational pose of each object is estimated in a 3D pose estimation network. A series of convolutional neural networks conducts feature extraction from images and 3D model shapes. Then, the network outputs the estimated Euler angles of the camera orientation with respect to the object in the input image. By only storing data associated with a detected change in pose, we minimize necessary storage and bandwidth requirements while still being able to recreate the 3D scene on demand.      
### 30.DMN4: Few-shot Learning via Discriminative Mutual Nearest Neighbor Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08160.pdf)
>  Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to classify images under low-data regimes, where the conventional pooled global representation is likely to lose useful local characteristics. Recent work has achieved promising performances by using deep descriptors. They generally take all deep descriptors from neural networks into consideration while ignoring that some of them are useless in classification due to their limited receptive field, e.g., task-irrelevant descriptors could be misleading and multiple aggregative descriptors from background clutter could even overwhelm the object's presence. In this paper, we argue that a Mutual Nearest Neighbor (MNN) relation should be established to explicitly select the query descriptors that are most relevant to each task and discard less relevant ones from aggregative clutters in FSL. Specifically, we propose Discriminative Mutual Nearest Neighbor Neural Network (DMN4) for FSL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only qualitatively selects task-relevant descriptors but also quantitatively outperforms the existing state-of-the-arts by a large margin of 1.8~4.9% on fine-grained CUB, a considerable margin of 1.4~2.2% on both supervised and semi-supervised miniImagenet, and ~1.4% on challenging tieredimagenet.      
### 31.LARNet: Lie Algebra Residual Network for Profile Face Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08147.pdf)
>  Due to large variations between profile and frontal faces, profile-based face recognition remains as a tremendous challenge in many practical vision scenarios. Traditional techniques address this challenge either by synthesizing frontal faces or by pose-invariants learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method with Lie algebra theory to explore how face rotation in the 3D space affects the deep feature generation process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We prove that face rotation in the image space is equivalent to an additive residual component in the feature space of CNNs, which is determined solely by the rotation. Based on this theoretical finding, we further design a Lie algebraic residual network (LARNet) for tackling profile-based face recognition. Our LARNet consists of a residual subnet for decoding rotation information from input face images, and a gating subnet to learn rotation magnitude for controlling the number of residual components contributing to the feature learning process. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on frontal-profile face datasets and general face recognition datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts.      
### 32.Detection and Localization of Facial Expression Manipulations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08134.pdf)
>  Concern regarding the wide-spread use of fraudulent images/videos in social media necessitates precise detection of such fraud. The importance of facial expressions in communication is widely known, and adversarial attacks often focus on manipulating the expression related features. Thus, it is important to develop methods that can detect manipulations in facial expressions, and localize the manipulated regions. To address this problem, we propose a framework that is able to detect manipulations in facial expression using a close combination of facial expression recognition and image manipulation methods. With the addition of feature maps extracted from the facial expression recognition framework, our manipulation detector is able to localize the manipulated region. We show that, on the Face2Face dataset, where there is abundant expression manipulation, our method achieves over 3% higher accuracy for both classification and localization of manipulations compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, results on the NeuralTextures dataset where the facial expressions corresponding to the mouth regions have been modified, show 2% higher accuracy in both classification and localization of manipulation. We demonstrate that the method performs at-par with the state-of-the-art methods in cases where the expression is not manipulated, but rather the identity is changed, thus ensuring generalizability of the approach.      
### 33.R-PointHop: A Green, Accurate and Unsupervised Point Cloud Registration Method  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08129.pdf)
>  Inspired by the recent PointHop classification method, an unsupervised 3D point cloud registration method, called R-PointHop, is proposed in this work. R-PointHop first determines a local reference frame (LRF) for every point using its nearest neighbors and finds its local attributes. Next, R-PointHop obtains local-to-global hierarchical features by point downsampling, neighborhood expansion, attribute construction and dimensionality reduction steps. Thus, we can build the correspondence of points in the hierarchical feature space using the nearest neighbor rule. Afterwards, a subset of salient points of good correspondence is selected to estimate the 3D transformation. The use of LRF allows for hierarchical features of points to be invariant with respect to rotation and translation, thus making R-PointHop more robust in building point correspondence even when rotation angles are large. Experiments are conducted on the ModelNet40 and the Stanford Bunny dataset, which demonstrate the effectiveness of R-PointHop on the 3D point cloud registration task. R-PointHop is a green and accurate solution since its model size and training time are smaller than those of deep learning methods by an order of magnitude while its registration errors are smaller. Our codes are available on GitHub.      
### 34.Improving Generalization of Transfer Learning Across Domains Using Spatio-Temporal Features in Autonomous Driving  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08116.pdf)
>  Training vision-based autonomous driving in the real world can be inefficient and impractical. Vehicle simulation can be used to learn in the virtual world, and the acquired skills can be transferred to handle real-world scenarios more effectively. Between virtual and real visual domains, common features such as relative distance to road edges and other vehicles over time are consistent. These visual elements are intuitively crucial for human decision making during driving. We hypothesize that these spatio-temporal factors can also be used in transfer learning to improve generalization across domains. First, we propose a CNN+LSTM transfer learning framework to extract the spatio-temporal features representing vehicle dynamics from scenes. Next, we conduct an ablation study to quantitatively estimate the significance of various features in the decisions of driving systems. We observe that physically interpretable factors are highly correlated with network decisions, while representational differences between scenes are not. Finally, based on the results of our ablation study, we propose a transfer learning pipeline that uses saliency maps and physical features extracted from a source model to enhance the performance of a target model. Training of our network is initialized with the learned weights from CNN and LSTM latent features (capturing the intrinsic physics of the moving vehicle w.r.t. its surroundings) transferred from one domain to another. Our experiments show that this proposed transfer learning framework better generalizes across unseen domains compared to a baseline CNN model on a binary classification learning task.      
### 35.Boundary Proposal Network for Two-Stage Natural Language Video Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08109.pdf)
>  We aim to address the problem of Natural Language Video Localization (NLVL)-localizing the video segment corresponding to a natural language description in a long and untrimmed video. State-of-the-art NLVL methods are almost in one-stage fashion, which can be typically grouped into two categories: 1) anchor-based approach: it first pre-defines a series of video segment candidates (e.g., by sliding window), and then does classification for each candidate; 2) anchor-free approach: it directly predicts the probabilities for each video frame as a boundary or intermediate frame inside the positive segment. However, both kinds of one-stage approaches have inherent drawbacks: the anchor-based approach is susceptible to the heuristic rules, further limiting the capability of handling videos with variant length. While the anchor-free approach fails to exploit the segment-level interaction thus achieving inferior results. In this paper, we propose a novel Boundary Proposal Network (BPNet), a universal two-stage framework that gets rid of the issues mentioned above. Specifically, in the first stage, BPNet utilizes an anchor-free model to generate a group of high-quality candidate video segments with their boundaries. In the second stage, a visual-language fusion layer is proposed to jointly model the multi-modal interaction between the candidate and the language query, followed by a matching score rating layer that outputs the alignment score for each candidate. We evaluate our BPNet on three challenging NLVL benchmarks (i.e., Charades-STA, TACoS and ActivityNet-Captions). Extensive experiments and ablative studies on these datasets demonstrate that the BPNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 36.Classifying Cycling Hazards in Egocentric Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08102.pdf)
>  This proposal is for the creation and annotation of an egocentric video data set of hazardous cycling situations. The resulting data set will facilitate projects to improve the safety and experience of cyclists. Since cyclists are highly sensitive to road surface conditions and hazards they require more detail about road conditions when navigating their route. Features such as tram tracks, cobblestones, gratings, and utility access points can pose hazards or uncomfortable riding conditions for their journeys. Possible uses for the data set are identifying existing hazards in cycling infrastructure for municipal authorities, real time hazard and surface condition warnings for cyclists, and the identification of conditions that cause cyclists to make sudden changes in their immediate route.      
### 37.Exploring Genetic-histologic Relationships in Breast Cancer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08082.pdf)
>  The advent of digital pathology presents opportunities for computer vision for fast, accurate, and objective solutions for histopathological images and aid in knowledge discovery. This work uses deep learning to predict genomic biomarkers - TP53 mutation, PIK3CA mutation, ER status, PR status, HER2 status, and intrinsic subtypes, from breast cancer histopathology images. Furthermore, we attempt to understand the underlying morphology as to how these genomic biomarkers manifest in images. Since gene sequencing is expensive, not always available, or even feasible, predicting these biomarkers from images would help in diagnosis, prognosis, and effective treatment planning. We outperform the existing works with a minimum improvement of 0.02 and a maximum of 0.13 AUROC scores across all tasks. We also gain insights that can serve as hypotheses for further experimentations, including the presence of lymphocytes and karyorrhexis. Moreover, our fully automated workflow can be extended to other tasks across other cancer subtypes.      
### 38.Pushing the Limits of Capsule Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08074.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural networks use pooling and other downscaling operations to maintain translational invariance for detection of features, but in their architecture they do not explicitly maintain a representation of the locations of the features relative to each other. This means they do not represent two instances of the same object in different orientations the same way, like humans do, and so training them often requires extensive data augmentation and exceedingly deep networks. A team at Google Brain recently made news with an attempt to fix this problem: Capsule Networks. While a normal CNN works with scalar outputs representing feature presence, a CapsNet works with vector outputs representing entity presence. We want to stress test CapsNet in various incremental ways to better understand their performance and expressiveness. In broad terms, the goals of our investigation are: (1) test CapsNets on datasets that are like MNIST but harder in a specific way, and (2) explore the internal embedding space and sources of error for CapsNets.      
### 39.Versailles-FP dataset: Wall Detection in Ancient  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08064.pdf)
>  Access to historical monuments' floor plans over a time period is necessary to understand the architectural evolution and history. Such knowledge bases also helps to rebuild the history by establishing connection between different event, person and facts which are once part of the buildings. Since the two-dimensional plans do not capture the entire space, 3D modeling sheds new light on the reading of these unique archives and thus opens up great perspectives for understanding the ancient states of the monument. Since the first step in the building's or monument's 3D model is the wall detection in the floor plan, we introduce in this paper the new and unique Versailles FP dataset of wall groundtruthed images of the Versailles Palace dated between 17th and 18th century. The dataset's wall masks are generated using an automatic approach based on multi directional steerable filters. The generated wall masks are then validated and corrected manually. We validate our approach of wall mask generation in state-of-the-art modern datasets. Finally we propose a U net based convolutional framework for wall detection. Our method achieves state of the art result surpassing fully connected network based approach.      
### 40.Deep Tiling: Texture Tile Synthesis Using a Deep Learning Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07992.pdf)
>  Texturing is a fundamental process in computer graphics. Texture is leveraged to enhance the visualization outcome for a 3D scene. In many cases a texture image cannot cover a large 3D model surface because of its small resolution. Conventional techniques like repeating, mirror repeating or clamp to edge do not yield visually acceptable results. Deep learning based texture synthesis has proven to be very effective in such cases. All deep texture synthesis methods trying to create larger resolution textures are limited in terms of GPU memory resources. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to example-based texture synthesis by using a robust deep learning process for creating tiles of arbitrary resolutions that resemble the structural components of an input texture. In this manner, our method is firstly much less memory limited owing to the fact that a new texture tile of small size is synthesized and merged with the original texture and secondly can easily produce missing parts of a large texture.      
### 41.TransFG: A Transformer Architecture for Fine-grained Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07976.pdf)
>  Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) which aims at recognizing objects from subcategories is a very challenging task due to the inherently subtle inter-class differences. Recent works mainly tackle this problem by focusing on how to locate the most discriminative image regions and rely on them to improve the capability of networks to capture subtle variances. Most of these works achieve this by using an RPN module to propose bounding boxes and re-use the backbone network to extract features of selected boxes. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) shows its strong performance in the traditional classification task. The self-attention mechanism of the transformer links every patch token to the classification token. The strength of the attention link can be intuitively considered as an indicator of the importance of tokens. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based framework TransFG where we integrate all raw attention weights of the transformer into an attention map for guiding the network to effectively and accurately select discriminative image patches and compute their relations. A duplicate loss is introduced to encourage multiple attention heads to focus on different regions. In addition, a contrastive loss is applied to further enlarge the distance between feature representations of similar sub-classes. We demonstrate the value of TransFG by conducting experiments on five popular fine-grained benchmarks: CUB-200-2011, Stanford Cars, Stanford Dogs, NABirds and iNat2017 where we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Qualitative results are presented for better understanding of our model.      
### 42.Monte Carlo Scene Search for 3D Scene Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07969.pdf)
>  We explore how a general AI algorithm can be used for 3D scene understanding in order to reduce the need for training data. More exactly, we propose a modification of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to retrieve objects and room layouts from noisy RGB-D scans. While MCTS was developed as a game-playing algorithm, we show it can also be used for complex perception problems. It has few easy-to-tune hyperparameters and can optimise general losses. We use it to optimise the posterior probability of objects and room layout hypotheses given the RGB-D data. This results in an analysis-by-synthesis approach that explores the solution space by rendering the current solution and comparing it to the RGB-D observations. To perform this exploration even more efficiently, we propose simple changes to the standard MCTS' tree construction and exploration policy. We demonstrate our approach on the ScanNet dataset. Our method often retrieves configurations that are better than some manual annotations especially on layouts.      
### 43.Modular Interactive Video Object Segmentation: Interaction-to-Mask, Propagation and Difference-Aware Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07941.pdf)
>  We present Modular interactive VOS (MiVOS) framework which decouples interaction-to-mask and mask propagation, allowing for higher generalizability and better performance. Trained separately, the interaction module converts user interactions to an object mask, which is then temporally propagated by our propagation module using a novel top-$k$ filtering strategy in reading the space-time memory. To effectively take the user's intent into account, a novel difference-aware module is proposed to learn how to properly fuse the masks before and after each interaction, which are aligned with the target frames by employing the space-time memory. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and quantitatively with different forms of user interactions (e.g., scribbles, clicks) on DAVIS to show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms while requiring fewer frame interactions, with the additional advantage in generalizing to different types of user interactions. We contribute a large-scale synthetic VOS dataset with pixel-accurate segmentation of 4.8M frames to accompany our source codes to facilitate future research.      
### 44.Semi-Supervised Video Deraining with Dynamic Rain Generator  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07939.pdf)
>  While deep learning (DL)-based video deraining methods have achieved significant success recently, they still exist two major drawbacks. Firstly, most of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of rainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties (e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural continuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the spatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods seriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are always deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic and real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real scenarios. Against these issues, this paper proposes a new semi-supervised video deraining method, in which a dynamic rain generator is employed to fit the rain layer, expecting to better depict its insightful characteristics. Specifically, such dynamic generator consists of one emission model and one transition model to simultaneously encode the spatially physical structure and temporally continuous changes of rain streaks, respectively, which both are parameterized as deep neural networks (DNNs). Further more, different prior formats are designed for the labeled synthetic and unlabeled real data, so as to fully exploit the common knowledge underlying them. Last but not least, we also design a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to solve this model. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the superiorities of the proposed semi-supervised deraining model.      
### 45.SaNet: Scale-aware neural Network for Parsing Multiple Spatial Resolution Aerial Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07935.pdf)
>  Assigning the geospatial objects of aerial images with categorical information at the pixel-level is a basic task in urban scene understanding. However, the huge differencc in remote sensing sensors makes the acqured aerial images in multiple spatial resolution (MSR), which brings two issues: the increased scale variation of geospatial objects and informative feature loss as spatial resolution drops. To address the two issues, we propose a novel scale-aware neural network (SaNet) for parsing MSR aerial images. For coping with the imbalanced segmentation quality between larger and smaller objects caused by the scale variation, the SaNet deploys a densely connected feature network (DCFPN) module to capture quality multi-scale context with large receptive fields. To alleviate the informative feature loss, a SFR module is incorporated into the network to learn scale-invariant features with spatial relation enhancement. Extensive experimental results on the ISPRS Vaihingen 2D Dataset and ISPRS Potsdam 2D Dataset demonstrate the outstanding cross-resolution segmentation ability of the proposed SaNet compared to other state-of-the-art networks.      
### 46.Towards Generalizable and Robust Face Manipulation Detection via Bag-of-local-feature  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07915.pdf)
>  Over the past several years, in order to solve the problem of malicious abuse of facial manipulation technology, face manipulation detection technology has obtained considerable attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, most existing methods have very impoverished generalization ability and robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel method for face manipulation detection, which can improve the generalization ability and robustness by bag-of-local-feature. Specifically, we extend Transformers using bag-of-feature approach to encode inter-patch relationships, allowing it to learn local forgery features without any explicit supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can outperform competing state-of-the-art methods on FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF and DeeperForensics-1.0 datasets.      
### 47.Bangla Handwritten Digit Recognition and Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07905.pdf)
>  Handwritten digit or numeral recognition is one of the classical issues in the area of pattern recognition and has seen tremendous advancement because of the recent wide availability of computing resources. Plentiful works have already done on English, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese handwritten script. Some work on Bangla also have been done but there is space for development. From that angle, in this paper, an architecture has been implemented which achieved the validation accuracy of 99.44% on BHAND dataset and outperforms Alexnet and Inception V3 architecture. Beside digit recognition, digit generation is another field which has recently caught the attention of the researchers though not many works have been done in this field especially on Bangla. In this paper, a Semi-Supervised Generative Adversarial Network or SGAN has been applied to generate Bangla handwritten numerals and it successfully generated Bangla digits.      
### 48.Principled Ultrasound Data Augmentation for Classification of Standard Planes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07895.pdf)
>  Deep learning models with large learning capacities often overfit to medical imaging datasets. This is because training sets are often relatively small due to the significant time and financial costs incurred in medical data acquisition and labelling. Data augmentation is therefore often used to expand the availability of training data and to increase generalization. However, augmentation strategies are often chosen on an ad-hoc basis without justification. In this paper, we present an augmentation policy search method with the goal of improving model classification performance. We include in the augmentation policy search additional transformations that are often used in medical image analysis and evaluate their performance. In addition, we extend the augmentation policy search to include non-linear mixed-example data augmentation strategies. Using these learned policies, we show that principled data augmentation for medical image model training can lead to significant improvements in ultrasound standard plane detection, with an an average F1-score improvement of 7.0% overall over naive data augmentation strategies in ultrasound fetal standard plane classification. We find that the learned representations of ultrasound images are better clustered and defined with optimized data augmentation.      
### 49.Refer-it-in-RGBD: A Bottom-up Approach for 3D Visual Grounding in RGBD Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07894.pdf)
>  Grounding referring expressions in RGBD image has been an emerging field. We present a novel task of 3D visual grounding in single-view RGBD image where the referred objects are often only partially scanned due to occlusion. In contrast to previous works that directly generate object proposals for grounding in the 3D scenes, we propose a bottom-up approach to gradually aggregate context-aware information, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the partial geometry. Our approach first fuses the language and the visual features at the bottom level to generate a heatmap that coarsely localizes the relevant regions in the RGBD image. Then our approach conducts an adaptive feature learning based on the heatmap and performs the object-level matching with another visio-linguistic fusion to finally ground the referred object. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing to the state-of-the-art methods on both the RGBD images extracted from the ScanRefer dataset and our newly collected SUNRefer dataset. Experiments show that our method outperforms the previous methods by a large margin (by 11.2% and 15.6% Acc@0.5) on both datasets.      
### 50.DivCo: Diverse Conditional Image Synthesis via Contrastive Generative Adversarial Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07893.pdf)
>  Conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) target at synthesizing diverse images given the input conditions and latent codes, but unfortunately, they usually suffer from the issue of mode collapse. To solve this issue, previous works mainly focused on encouraging the correlation between the latent codes and their generated images, while ignoring the relations between images generated from various latent codes. The recent MSGAN tried to encourage the diversity of the generated image but only considers "negative" relations between the image pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel DivCo framework to properly constrain both "positive" and "negative" relations between the generated images specified in the latent space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use contrastive learning for diverse conditional image synthesis. A novel latent-augmented contrastive loss is introduced, which encourages images generated from adjacent latent codes to be similar and those generated from distinct latent codes to be dissimilar. The proposed latent-augmented contrastive loss is well compatible with various cGAN architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DivCo can produce more diverse images than state-of-the-art methods without sacrificing visual quality in multiple unpaired and paired image generation tasks.      
### 51.Learning a Proposal Classifier for Multiple Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07889.pdf)
>  The recent trend in multiple object tracking (MOT) is heading towards leveraging deep learning to boost the tracking performance. However, it is not trivial to solve the data-association problem in an end-to-end fashion. In this paper, we propose a novel proposal-based learnable framework, which models MOT as a proposal generation, proposal scoring and trajectory inference paradigm on an affinity graph. This framework is similar to the two-stage object detector Faster RCNN, and can solve the MOT problem in a data-driven way. For proposal generation, we propose an iterative graph clustering method to reduce the computational cost while maintaining the quality of the generated proposals. For proposal scoring, we deploy a trainable graph-convolutional-network (GCN) to learn the structural patterns of the generated proposals and rank them according to the estimated quality scores. For trajectory inference, a simple deoverlapping strategy is adopted to generate tracking output while complying with the constraints that no detection can be assigned to more than one track. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a clear performance improvement in both MOTA and IDF1 with respect to previous state-of-the-art on two public benchmarks.

### 52.Three Steps to Multimodal Trajectory Prediction: Modality Clustering, Classification and Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07854.pdf)
>  Multimodal prediction results are essential for trajectory forecasting task as there is no single correct answer for the future. Previous frameworks can be divided into three categories: regression, generation and classification frameworks. However, these frameworks have weaknesses in different aspects so that they cannot model the multimodal prediction task comprehensively. In this paper, we present a novel insight along with a brand-new prediction framework by formulating multimodal prediction into three steps: modality clustering, classification and synthesis, and address the shortcomings of earlier frameworks. Exhaustive experiments on popular benchmarks have demonstrated that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art works even without introducing social and map information. Specifically, we achieve 19.2% and 20.8% improvement on ADE and FDE respectively on ETH/UCY dataset. Our code will be made publicly available.      
### 53.Cycle4Completion: Unpaired Point Cloud Completion using Cycle Transformation with Missing Region Coding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07838.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a novel unpaired point cloud completion network, named Cycle4Completion, to infer the complete geometries from a partial 3D object. Previous unpaired completion methods merely focus on the learning of geometric correspondence from incomplete shapes to complete shapes, and ignore the learning in the reverse direction, which makes them suffer from low completion accuracy due to the limited 3D shape understanding ability. To address this problem, we propose two simultaneous cycle transformations between the latent spaces of complete shapes and incomplete ones. The insight of cycle transformation is to promote networks to understand 3D shapes by learning to generate complete or incomplete shapes from their complementary ones. Specifically, the first cycle transforms shapes from incomplete domain to complete domain, and then projects them back to the incomplete domain. This process learns the geometric characteristic of complete shapes, and maintains the shape consistency between the complete prediction and the incomplete input. Similarly, the inverse cycle transformation starts from complete domain to incomplete domain, and goes back to complete domain to learn the characteristic of incomplete shapes. We provide a comprehensive evaluation in experiments, which shows that our model with the learned bidirectional geometry correspondence outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired completion methods.      
### 54.Radar Camera Fusion via Representation Learning in Autonomous Driving  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07825.pdf)
>  Radars and cameras are mature, cost-effective, and robust sensors and have been widely used in the perception stack of mass-produced autonomous driving systems. Due to their complementary properties, outputs from radar detection (radar pins) and camera perception (2D bounding boxes) are usually fused to generate the best perception results. The key to successful radar-camera fusion is accurate data association. The challenges in radar-camera association can be attributed to the complexity of driving scenes, the noisy and sparse nature of radar measurements, and the depth ambiguity from 2D bounding boxes. Traditional rule-based association methods are susceptible to performance degradation in challenging scenarios and failure in corner cases. In this study, we propose to address rad-cam association via deep representation learning, to explore feature-level interaction and global reasoning. Concretely, we design a loss sampling mechanism and an innovative ordinal loss to overcome the difficulty of imperfect labeling and to enforce critical human reasoning. Despite being trained with noisy labels generated by a rule-based algorithm, our proposed method achieves a performance of 92.2% F1 score, which is 11.6% higher than the rule-based teacher. Moreover, this data-driven method also lends itself to continuous improvement via corner case mining.      
### 55.ORStereo: Occlusion-Aware Recurrent Stereo Matching for 4K-Resolution Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07798.pdf)
>  Stereo reconstruction models trained on small images do not generalize well to high-resolution data. Training a model on high-resolution image size faces difficulties of data availability and is often infeasible due to limited computing resources. In this work, we present the Occlusion-aware Recurrent binocular Stereo matching (ORStereo), which deals with these issues by only training on available low disparity range stereo images. ORStereo generalizes to unseen high-resolution images with large disparity ranges by formulating the task as residual updates and refinements of an initial prediction. ORStereo is trained on images with disparity ranges limited to 256 pixels, yet it can operate 4K-resolution input with over 1000 disparities using limited GPU memory. We test the model's capability on both synthetic and real-world high-resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate that ORStereo achieves comparable performance on 4K-resolution images compared to state-of-the-art methods trained on large disparity ranges. Compared to other methods that are only trained on low-resolution images, our method is 70% more accurate on 4K-resolution images.      
### 56.A Few-Shot Learning Approach for Accelerated MRI via Fusion of Data-Driven and Subject-Driven Priors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07790.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently found emerging use in accelerated MRI reconstruction. DNNs typically learn data-driven priors from large datasets constituting pairs of undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions. Acquiring such large datasets, however, might be impractical. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a few-shot learning approach for accelerated MRI that merges subject-driven priors obtained via physical signal models with data-driven priors obtained from a few training samples. Demonstrations on brain MR images from the NYU fastMRI dataset indicate that the proposed approach requires just a few samples to outperform traditional parallel imaging and DNN algorithms.      
### 57.Image Segmentation Methods for Non-destructive testing Applications  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07754.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present new image segmentation methods based on hidden Markov random fields (HMRFs) and cuckoo search (CS) variants. HMRFs model the segmentation problem as a minimization of an energy function. CS algorithm is one of the recent powerful optimization techniques. Therefore, five variants of the CS algorithm are used to compute a solution. Through tests, we conduct a study to choose the CS variant with parameters that give good results (execution time and quality of segmentation). CS variants are evaluated and compared with non-destructive testing (NDT) images using a misclassification error (ME) criterion.      
### 58.Unsupervised Image Transformation Learning via Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07751.pdf)
>  In this work, we study the image transformation problem by learning the underlying transformations from a collection of images using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically, we propose an unsupervised learning framework, termed as TrGAN, to project images onto a transformation space that is shared by the generator and the discriminator. Any two points in this projected space define a transformation that can guide the image generation process, leading to continuous semantic change. By projecting a pair of images onto the transformation space, we are able to adequately extract the semantic variation between them and further apply the extracted semantic to facilitating image editing, including not only transferring image styles (e.g., changing day to night) but also manipulating image contents (e.g., adding clouds in the sky).

### 59.Reconsidering Representation Alignment for Multi-view Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07738.pdf)
>  Aligning distributions of view representations is a core component of today's state of the art models for deep multi-view clustering. However, we identify several drawbacks with naïvely aligning representation distributions. We demonstrate that these drawbacks both lead to less separable clusters in the representation space, and inhibit the model's ability to prioritize views. Based on these observations, we develop a simple baseline model for deep multi-view clustering. Our baseline model avoids representation alignment altogether, while performing similar to, or better than, the current state of the art. We also expand our baseline model by adding a contrastive learning component. This introduces a selective alignment procedure that preserves the model's ability to prioritize views. Our experiments show that the contrastive learning component enhances the baseline model, improving on the current state of the art by a large margin on several datasets.      
### 60.ReDet: A Rotation-equivariant Detector for Aerial Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07733.pdf)
>  Recently, object detection in aerial images has gained much attention in computer vision. Different from objects in natural images, aerial objects are often distributed with arbitrary orientation. Therefore, the detector requires more parameters to encode the orientation information, which are often highly redundant and inefficient. Moreover, as ordinary CNNs do not explicitly model the orientation variation, large amounts of rotation augmented data is needed to train an accurate object detector. In this paper, we propose a Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) to address these issues, which explicitly encodes rotation equivariance and rotation invariance. More precisely, we incorporate rotation-equivariant networks into the detector to extract rotation-equivariant features, which can accurately predict the orientation and lead to a huge reduction of model size. Based on the rotation-equivariant features, we also present Rotation-invariant RoI Align (RiRoI Align), which adaptively extracts rotation-invariant features from equivariant features according to the orientation of RoI. Extensive experiments on several challenging aerial image datasets DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016, show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the task of aerial object detection. Compared with previous best results, our ReDet gains 1.2, 3.5 and 2.6 mAP on DOTA-v1.0, DOTA-v1.5 and HRSC2016 respectively while reducing the number of parameters by 60\% (313 Mb vs. 121 Mb).

### 61.NeuralHumanFVV: Real-Time Neural Volumetric Human Performance Rendering using RGB Cameras  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07700.pdf)
>  4D reconstruction and rendering of human activities is critical for immersive VR/AR experience.Recent advances still fail to recover fine geometry and texture results with the level of detail present in the input images from sparse multi-view RGB cameras. In this paper, we propose NeuralHumanFVV, a real-time neural human performance capture and rendering system to generate both high-quality geometry and photo-realistic texture of human activities in arbitrary novel views. We propose a neural geometry generation scheme with a hierarchical sampling strategy for real-time implicit geometry inference, as well as a novel neural blending scheme to generate high resolution (e.g., 1k) and photo-realistic texture results in the novel views. Furthermore, we adopt neural normal blending to enhance geometry details and formulate our neural geometry and texture rendering into a multi-task learning framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality geometry and photo-realistic free view-point reconstruction for challenging human performances.      
### 62.uTHCD: A New Benchmarking for Tamil Handwritten OCR  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07676.pdf)
>  Handwritten character recognition is a challenging research in the field of document image analysis over many decades due to numerous reasons such as large writing styles variation, inherent noise in data, expansive applications it offers, non-availability of benchmark databases etc. There has been considerable work reported in literature about creation of the database for several Indic scripts but the Tamil script is still in its infancy as it has been reported only in one database [5]. In this paper, we present the work done in the creation of an exhaustive and large unconstrained Tamil Handwritten Character Database (uTHCD). Database consists of around 91000 samples with nearly 600 samples in each of 156 classes. The database is a unified collection of both online and offline samples. Offline samples were collected by asking volunteers to write samples on a form inside a specified grid. For online samples, we made the volunteers write in a similar grid using a digital writing pad. The samples collected encompass a vast variety of writing styles, inherent distortions arising from offline scanning process viz stroke discontinuity, variable thickness of stroke, distortion etc. Algorithms which are resilient to such data can be practically deployed for real time applications. The samples were generated from around 650 native Tamil volunteers including school going kids, homemakers, university students and faculty. The isolated character database will be made publicly available as raw images and Hierarchical Data File (HDF) compressed file. With this database, we expect to set a new benchmark in Tamil handwritten character recognition and serve as a launchpad for many avenues in document image analysis domain. Paper also presents an ideal experimental set-up using the database on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a baseline accuracy of 88% on test data.      
### 63.PhotoApp: Photorealistic Appearance Editing of Head Portraits  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07658.pdf)
>  Photorealistic editing of portraits is a challenging task as humans are very sensitive to inconsistencies in faces. We present an approach for high-quality intuitive editing of the camera viewpoint and scene illumination in a portrait image. This requires our method to capture and control the full reflectance field of the person in the image. Most editing approaches rely on supervised learning using training data captured with setups such as light and camera stages. Such datasets are expensive to acquire, not readily available and do not capture all the rich variations of in-the-wild portrait images. In addition, most supervised approaches only focus on relighting, and do not allow camera viewpoint editing. Thus, they only capture and control a subset of the reflectance field. Recently, portrait editing has been demonstrated by operating in the generative model space of StyleGAN. While such approaches do not require direct supervision, there is a significant loss of quality when compared to the supervised approaches. In this paper, we present a method which learns from limited supervised training data. The training images only include people in a fixed neutral expression with eyes closed, without much hair or background variations. Each person is captured under 150 one-light-at-a-time conditions and under 8 camera poses. Instead of training directly in the image space, we design a supervised problem which learns transformations in the latent space of StyleGAN. This combines the best of supervised learning and generative adversarial modeling. We show that the StyleGAN prior allows for generalisation to different expressions, hairstyles and backgrounds. This produces high-quality photorealistic results for in-the-wild images and significantly outperforms existing methods. Our approach can edit the illumination and pose simultaneously, and runs at interactive rates.      
### 64.Generating Unrestricted Adversarial Examples via Three Parameters  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07640.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial examples deliberately constructed to misclassify victim models. As most adversarial examples have restricted their perturbations to $L_{p}$-norm, existing defense methods have focused on these types of perturbations and less attention has been paid to unrestricted adversarial examples; which can create more realistic attacks, able to deceive models without affecting human predictions. To address this problem, the proposed adversarial attack generates an unrestricted adversarial example with a limited number of parameters. The attack selects three points on the input image and based on their locations transforms the image into an adversarial example. By limiting the range of movement and location of these three points and using a discriminatory network, the proposed unrestricted adversarial example preserves the image appearance. Experimental results show that the proposed adversarial examples obtain an average success rate of 93.5% in terms of human evaluation on the MNIST and SVHN datasets. It also reduces the model accuracy by an average of 73% on six datasets MNIST, FMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet. It should be noted that, in the case of attacks, lower accuracy in the victim model denotes a more successful attack. The adversarial train of the attack also improves model robustness against a randomly transformed image.      
### 65.Potential Escalator-related Injury Identification and Prevention Based on Multi-module Integrated System for Public Health  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07620.pdf)
>  Escalator-related injuries threaten public health with the widespread use of escalators. The existing studies tend to focus on after-the-fact statistics, reflecting on the original design and use of defects to reduce the impact of escalator-related injuries, but few attention has been paid to ongoing and impending injuries. In this study, a multi-module escalator safety monitoring system based on computer vision is designed and proposed to simultaneously monitor and deal with three major injury triggers, including losing balance, not holding on to handrails and carrying large items. The escalator identification module is utilized to determine the escalator region, namely the region of interest. The passenger monitoring module is leveraged to estimate the passengers' pose to recognize unsafe behaviors on the escalator. The dangerous object detection module detects large items that may enter the escalator and raises alarms. The processing results of the above three modules are summarized in the safety assessment module as the basis for the intelligent decision of the system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system has good performance and great application potential.      
### 66.An Efficient Multitask Neural Network for Face Alignment, Head Pose Estimation and Face Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07615.pdf)
>  While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly boosted the performance of face related algorithms, maintaining accuracy and efficiency simultaneously in practical use remains challenging. Recent study shows that using a cascade of hourglass modules which consist of a number of bottom-up and top-down convolutional layers can extract facial structural information for face alignment to improve accuracy. However, previous studies have shown that features produced by shallow convolutional layers are highly correspond to edges. These features could be directly used to provide the structural information without addition cost. Motivated by this intuition, we propose an efficient multitask face alignment, face tracking and head pose estimation network (ATPN). Specifically, we introduce a shortcut connection between shallow-layer features and deep-layer features to provide the structural information for face alignment and apply the CoordConv to the last few layers to provide coordinate information. The predicted facial landmarks enable us to generate a cheap heatmap which contains both geometric and appearance information for head pose estimation and it also provides attention clues for face tracking. Moreover, the face tracking task saves us the face detection procedure for each frame, which is significant to boost performance for video-based tasks. The proposed framework is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, WFLW, 300VW, WIDER Face and 300W-LP. The experimental results show that the ATPN achieves improved performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods while having less number of parameters and FLOPS.      
### 67.Revisiting ResNets: Improved Training and Scaling Strategies  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07579.pdf)
>  Novel computer vision architectures monopolize the spotlight, but the impact of the model architecture is often conflated with simultaneous changes to training methodology and scaling strategies. Our work revisits the canonical ResNet (He et al., 2015) and studies these three aspects in an effort to disentangle them. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that training and scaling strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the resulting ResNets match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution more slowly than previously recommended (Tan &amp; Le, 2019). Using improved training and scaling strategies, we design a family of ResNet architectures, ResNet-RS, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than EfficientNets on TPUs, while achieving similar accuracies on ImageNet. In a large-scale semi-supervised learning setup, ResNet-RS achieves 86.2% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, while being 4.7x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent. The training techniques improve transfer performance on a suite of downstream tasks (rivaling state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms) and extend to video classification on Kinetics-400. We recommend practitioners use these simple revised ResNets as baselines for future research.      
### 68.Dilated Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Depth Estimation from a Single Image  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07570.pdf)
>  Depth prediction plays a key role in understanding a 3D scene. Several techniques have been developed throughout the years, among which Convolutional Neural Network has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on estimating depth from a single image. However, traditional CNNs suffer from the lower resolution and information loss caused by the pooling layers. And oversized parameters generated from fully connected layers often lead to a exploded memory usage problem. In this paper, we present an advanced Dilated Fully Convolutional Neural Network to address the deficiencies. Taking advantages of the exponential expansion of the receptive field in dilated convolutions, our model can minimize the loss of resolution. It also reduces the amount of parameters significantly by replacing the fully connected layers with the fully convolutional layers. We show experimentally on NYU Depth V2 datasets that the depth prediction obtained from our model is considerably closer to ground truth than that from traditional CNNs techniques.      
### 69.Towards Learning Food Portion From Monocular Images With Cross-Domain Feature Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07562.pdf)
>  We aim to estimate food portion size, a property that is strongly related to the presence of food object in 3D space, from single monocular images under real life setting. Specifically, we are interested in end-to-end estimation of food portion size, which has great potential in the field of personal health management. Unlike image segmentation or object recognition where annotation can be obtained through large scale crowd sourcing, it is much more challenging to collect datasets for portion size estimation since human cannot accurately estimate the size of an object in an arbitrary 2D image without expert knowledge. To address such challenge, we introduce a real life food image dataset collected from a nutrition study where the groundtruth food energy (calorie) is provided by registered dietitians, and will be made available to the research community. We propose a deep regression process for portion size estimation by combining features estimated from both RGB and learned energy distribution domains. Our estimates of food energy achieved state-of-the-art with a MAPE of 11.47%, significantly outperforms non-expert human estimates by 27.56%.      
### 70.Uncertainty-guided Model Generalization to Unseen Domains  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07531.pdf)
>  We study a worst-case scenario in generalization: Out-of-domain generalization from a single source. The goal is to learn a robust model from a single source and expect it to generalize over many unknown distributions. This challenging problem has been seldom investigated while existing solutions suffer from various limitations. In this paper, we propose a new solution. The key idea is to augment the source capacity in both input and label spaces, while the augmentation is guided by uncertainty assessment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to (1) access the generalization uncertainty from a single source and (2) leverage it to guide both input and label augmentation for robust generalization. The model training and deployment are effectively organized in a Bayesian meta-learning framework. We conduct extensive comparisons and ablation study to validate our approach. The results prove our superior performance in a wide scope of tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, text classification, and speech recognition.      
### 71.Cross-Domain Similarity Learning for Face Recognition in Unseen Domains  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07503.pdf)
>  Face recognition models trained under the assumption of identical training and test distributions often suffer from poor generalization when faced with unknown variations, such as a novel ethnicity or unpredictable individual make-ups during test time. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-domain metric learning loss, which we dub Cross-Domain Triplet (CDT) loss, to improve face recognition in unseen domains. The CDT loss encourages learning semantically meaningful features by enforcing compact feature clusters of identities from one domain, where the compactness is measured by underlying similarity metrics that belong to another training domain with different statistics. Intuitively, it discriminatively correlates explicit metrics derived from one domain, with triplet samples from another domain in a unified loss function to be minimized within a network, which leads to better alignment of the training domains. The network parameters are further enforced to learn generalized features under domain shift, in a model-agnostic learning pipeline. Unlike the recent work of Meta Face Recognition, our method does not require careful hard-pair sample mining and filtering strategy during training. Extensive experiments on various face recognition benchmarks show the superiority of our method in handling variations, compared to baseline and the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 72.Lasry-Lions Envelopes and Nonconvex Optimization: A Homotopy Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08533.pdf)
>  In large-scale optimization, the presence of nonsmooth and nonconvex terms in a given problem typically makes it hard to solve. A popular approach to address nonsmooth terms in convex optimization is to approximate them with their respective Moreau envelopes. In this work, we study the use of Lasry-Lions double envelopes to approximate nonsmooth terms that are also not convex. These envelopes are an extension of the Moreau ones but exhibit an additional smoothness property that makes them amenable to fast optimization algorithms. Lasry-Lions envelopes can also be seen as an "intermediate" between a given function and its convex envelope, and we make use of this property to develop a method that builds a sequence of approximate subproblems that are easier to solve than the original problem. We discuss convergence properties of this method when used to address composite minimization problems; additionally, based on a number of experiments, we discuss settings where it may be more useful than classical alternatives in two domains: signal decoding and spectral unmixing.      
### 73.Which K-Space Sampling Schemes is good for Motion Artifact Detection in Magnetic Resonance Imaging?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08516.pdf)
>  Motion artifacts are a common occurrence in the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exam. Motion during acquisition has a profound impact on workflow efficiency, often requiring a repeat of sequences. Furthermore, motion artifacts may escape notice by technologists, only to be revealed at the time of reading by the radiologists, affecting their diagnostic quality. Designing a computer-aided tool for automatic motion detection and elimination can improve the diagnosis, however, it needs a deep understanding of motion characteristics. Motion artifacts in MRI have a complex nature and it is directly related to the k-space sampling scheme. In this study we investigate the effect of three conventional k-space samplers, including Cartesian, Uniform Spiral and Radial on motion induced image distortion. In this regard, various synthetic motions with different trajectories of displacement and rotation are applied to T1 and T2-weighted MRI images, and a convolutional neural network is trained to show the difficulty of motion classification. The results show that the spiral k-space sampling method get less effect of motion artifact in image space as compared to radial k-space sampled images, and radial k-space sampled images are more robust than Cartesian ones. Cartesian samplers, on the other hand, are the best in terms of deep learning motion detection because they can better reflect motion.      
### 74.DiaRet: A browser-based application for the grading of Diabetic Retinopathy with Integrated Gradients  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08501.pdf)
>  Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that results from defects in autoimmune beta-cell destruction in Type 1, peripheral resistance to insulin action in Type 2 or, most commonly, both. Patients with long-standing diabetes often fall prey to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) resulting in changes in the retina of the human eye, which may lead to loss of vision in extreme cases. The aim of this study is two-fold: (a) create deep learning models that were trained to grade degraded retinal fundus images and (b) to create a browser-based application that will aid in diagnostic procedures by highlighting the key features of the fundus image. Deep learning has proven to be a success for computer-aided DR diagnosis resulting in early-detection and prevention of blindness. In this research work, we have emulated the images plagued by distortions by degrading the images based on multiple different combinations of Light Transmission Disturbance, Image Blurring and insertion of Retinal Artifacts. These degraded images were used for the training of multiple Deep Learning based Convolutional Neural Networks. We have trained InceptionV3, ResNet-50 and InceptionResNetV2 on multiple datasets. These models were used to classify the fundus images in terms of DR severity level. The models were further used in the creation of a browser-based application, which demonstrates the models prediction and the probability associated with each class. It will also show the Integration Gradient (IG) Attribution Mask superimposed onto the input image. The creation of the browser-based application would aid in the diagnostic procedures performed by ophthalmologists by highlighting the key features of the fundus image based on an educated prediction made by the model.      
### 75.Sampling-free Variational Inference for Neural Networks with Multiplicative Activation Noise  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08497.pdf)
>  To adopt neural networks in safety critical domains, knowing whether we can trust their predictions is crucial. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide uncertainty estimates by averaging predictions with respect to the posterior weight distribution. Variational inference methods for BNNs approximate the intractable weight posterior with a tractable distribution, yet mostly rely on sampling from the variational distribution during training and inference. Recent sampling-free approaches offer an alternative, but incur a significant parameter overhead. We here propose a more efficient parameterization of the posterior approximation for sampling-free variational inference that relies on the distribution induced by multiplicative Gaussian activation noise. This allows us to combine parameter efficiency with the benefits of sampling-free variational inference. Our approach yields competitive results for standard regression problems and scales well to large-scale image classification tasks including ImageNet.      
### 76.Learning Frequency-aware Dynamic Network for Efficient Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08357.pdf)
>  Deep learning based methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied in the field of single image super-resolution (SISR). To obtain better fidelity and visual quality, most of existing networks are of heavy design with massive computation. However, the computation resources of modern mobile devices are limited, which cannot easily support the expensive cost. To this end, this paper explores a novel frequency-aware dynamic network for dividing the input into multiple parts according to its coefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. In practice, the high-frequency part will be processed using expensive operations and the lower-frequency part is assigned with cheap operations to relieve the computation burden. Since pixels or image patches belong to low-frequency areas contain relatively few textural details, this dynamic network will not affect the quality of resulting super-resolution images. In addition, we embed predictors into the proposed dynamic network to end-to-end fine-tune the handcrafted frequency-aware masks. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark SISR models and datasets show that the frequency-aware dynamic network can be employed for various SISR neural architectures to obtain the better tradeoff between visual quality and computational complexity. For instance, we can reduce the FLOPs of EDSR model by approximate $50\%$ while preserving state-of-the-art SISR performance.

>  Nematode worms are one of most abundant metazoan groups on the earth, occupying diverse ecological niches. Accurate recognition or identification of nematodes are of great importance for pest control, soil ecology, bio-geography, habitat conservation and against climate changes. Computer vision and image processing have witnessed a few successes in species recognition of nematodes; however, it is still in great demand. In this paper, we identify two main bottlenecks: (1) the lack of a publicly available imaging dataset for diverse species of nematodes (especially the species only found in natural environment) which requires considerable human resources in field work and experts in taxonomy, and (2) the lack of a standard benchmark of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques on this dataset which demands the discipline background in computer science. With these in mind, we propose an image dataset consisting of diverse nematodes (both laboratory cultured and naturally isolated), which, to our knowledge, is the first time in the community. We further set up a species recognition benchmark by employing state-of-the-art deep learning networks on this dataset. We discuss the experimental results, compare the recognition accuracy of different networks, and show the challenges of our dataset. We make our dataset publicly available at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/xuequanlu/I-Nema" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 78.The QXS-SAROPT Dataset for Deep Learning in SAR-Optical Data Fusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08259.pdf)
>  Deep learning techniques have made an increasing impact on the field of remote sensing. However, deep neural networks based fusion of multimodal data from different remote sensors with heterogenous characteristics has not been fully explored, due to the lack of availability of big amounts of perfectly aligned multi-sensor image data with diverse scenes of high resolution, especially for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and optical imagery. In this paper, we publish the QXS-SAROPT dataset to foster deep learning research in SAR-optical data fusion. QXS-SAROPT comprises 20,000 pairs of corresponding image patches, collected from three port cities: San Diego, Shanghai and Qingdao acquired by the SAR satellite GaoFen-3 and optical satellites of Google Earth. Besides a detailed description of the dataset, we show exemplary results for two representative applications, namely SAR-optical image matching and SAR ship detection boosted by cross-modal information from optical images. Since QXS-SAROPT is a large open dataset with multiple scenes of the highest resolution of this kind, we believe it will support further developments in the field of deep learning based SAR-optical data fusion for remote sensing.      
### 79.MBAPose: Mask and Bounding-Box Aware Pose Estimation of Surgical Instruments with Photorealistic Domain Randomization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.08105.pdf)
>  Surgical robots are controlled using a priori models based on robots' geometric parameters, which are calibrated before the surgical procedure. One of the challenges in using robots in real surgical settings is that parameters change over time, consequently deteriorating control accuracy. In this context, our group has been investigating online calibration strategies without added sensors. In one step toward that goal, we have developed an algorithm to estimate the pose of the instruments' shafts in endoscopic images. In this study, we build upon that earlier work and propose a new framework to more precisely estimate the pose of a rigid surgical instrument. Our strategy is based on a novel pose estimation model called MBAPose and the use of synthetic training data. Our experiments demonstrated an improvement of 21 % for translation error and 26 % for orientation error on synthetic test data with respect to our previous work. Results with real test data provide a baseline for further research.      
### 80.COVID-19 Infection Localization and Severity Grading from Chest X-ray Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07985.pdf)
>  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the main agenda of the whole world, since it came into sight in December 2019 as it has significantly affected the world economy and healthcare system. Given the effects of COVID-19 on pulmonary tissues, chest radiographic imaging has become a necessity for screening and monitoring the disease. Numerous studies have proposed Deep Learning approaches for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these methods achieved astonishing performance in detection, they have used limited chest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with a few hundred COVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation with the potential of overfitting. In addition, most studies showed no or limited capability in infection localization and severity grading of COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we address this urgent need by proposing a systematic and unified approach for lung segmentation and COVID-19 localization with infection quantification from CXR images. To accomplish this, we have constructed the largest benchmark dataset with 33,920 CXR images, including 11,956 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation of ground-truth lung segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel human-machine collaborative approach. An extensive set of experiments was performed using the state-of-the-art segmentation networks, U-Net, U-Net++, and Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN). The developed network, after an extensive iterative process, reached a superior performance for lung region segmentation with Intersection over Union (IoU) of 96.11% and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.99%. Furthermore, COVID-19 infections of various shapes and types were reliably localized with 83.05% IoU and 88.21% DSC. Finally, the proposed approach has achieved an outstanding COVID-19 detection performance with both sensitivity and specificity values above 99%.      
### 81.Progressive residual learning for single image dehazing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07973.pdf)
>  The recent physical model-free dehazing methods have achieved state-of-the-art performances. However, without the guidance of physical models, the performances degrade rapidly when applied to real scenarios due to the unavailable or insufficient data problems. On the other hand, the physical model-based methods have better interpretability but suffer from multi-objective optimizations of parameters, which may lead to sub-optimal dehazing results. In this paper, a progressive residual learning strategy has been proposed to combine the physical model-free dehazing process with reformulated scattering model-based dehazing operations, which enjoys the merits of dehazing methods in both categories. Specifically, the global atmosphere light and transmission maps are interactively optimized with the aid of accurate residual information and preliminary dehazed restorations from the initial physical model-free dehazing process. The proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods on public dehazing benchmarks with better model interpretability and adaptivity for complex hazy data.      
### 82.Multi-view data capture for dynamic object reconstruction using handheld augmented reality mobiles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07883.pdf)
>  We propose a system to capture nearly-synchronous frame streams from multiple and moving handheld mobiles that is suitable for dynamic object 3D reconstruction. Each mobile executes Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping on-board to estimate its pose, and uses a wireless communication channel to send or receive synchronisation triggers. Our system can harvest frames and mobile poses in real time using a decentralised triggering strategy and a data-relay architecture that can be deployed either at the Edge or in the Cloud. We show the effectiveness of our system by employing it for 3D skeleton and volumetric reconstructions. Our triggering strategy achieves equal performance to that of an NTP-based synchronisation approach, but offers higher flexibility, as it can be adjusted online based on application needs. We created a challenging new dataset, namely 4DM, that involves six handheld augmented reality mobiles recording an actor performing sports actions outdoors. We validate our system on 4DM, analyse its strengths and limitations, and compare its modules with alternative ones.      
### 83.Multi-Object Tracking using Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture Filtering for Autonomous Vehicles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07783.pdf)
>  The ability of an autonomous vehicle to perform 3D tracking is essential for safe planing and navigation in cluttered environments. The main challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT) in autonomous driving applications reside in the inherent uncertainties regarding the number of objects, when and where the objects may appear and disappear, and uncertainties regarding objects' states. Random finite set (RFS) based approaches can naturally model these uncertainties accurately and elegantly, and they have been widely used in radar-based tracking applications. In this work, we developed an RFS-based MOT framework for 3D LiDAR data. In partiuclar, we propose a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter to solve the amodal MOT problem for autonomous driving applications. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first attempt for employing an RFS-based approach in conjunction with 3D LiDAR data for MOT applications with comprehensive validation using challenging datasets made available by industry leaders. The superior experimental results of our PMBM tracker on public Waymo and Argoverse datasets clearly illustrate that an RFS-based tracker outperforms many state-of-the-art deep learning-based and Kalman filter-based methods, and consequently, these results indicate a great potential for further exploration of RFS-based frameworks for 3D MOT applications.      
### 84.VMAF And Variants: Towards A Unified VQA  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07770.pdf)
>  Video quality assessment (VQA) is now a fastgrowing subject, beginning to mature in the full reference (FR) case, while the burgeoning no reference (NR) case remains challenging. We investigate variants of the popular VMAF video quality assessment algorithm for the FR case, using support vector regression and feedforward neural networks, and extend it to the NR case, using the same learning architectures, to develop a partially unified framework for VQA. When heavily trained, algorithms such as VMAF perform well on test datasets, with 90%+ match; but predicting performance in the wild is better done by training/testing from scratch, as we do. Even from scratch, we achieve 90%+ performance in FR, with gains over VMAF. And we greatly reduce complexity vs. leading recent NR algorithms, VIDEVAL, RAPIQUE, yet exceed 80% in SRCC. In our preliminary testing, we find the improvements in trainability, while also constraining computational complexity, as quite encouraging, suggesting further study and analysis.      
### 85.Online Learning of Objects through Curiosity-Driven Active Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07758.pdf)
>  Children learn continually by asking questions about the concepts they are most curious about. With robots becoming an integral part of our society, they must also learn unknown concepts continually by asking humans questions. This paper presents a novel framework for curiosity-driven online learning of objects. The paper utilizes a recent state-of-the-art approach for continual learning and adapts it for online learning of objects. The paper further develops a self-supervised technique to find most of the uncertain objects in an environment by utilizing an internal representation of previously learned classes. We test our approach on a benchmark dataset for continual learning on robots. Our results show that our curiosity-driven online learning approach beats random sampling and softmax-based uncertainty sampling in terms of classification accuracy and the total number of classes learned.      
### 86.OCID-Ref: A 3D Robotic Dataset with Embodied Language for Clutter Scene Grounding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07679.pdf)
>  To effectively apply robots in working environments and assist humans, it is essential to develop and evaluate how visual grounding (VG) can affect machine performance on occluded objects. However, current VG works are limited in working environments, such as offices and warehouses, where objects are usually occluded due to space utilization issues. In our work, we propose a novel OCID-Ref dataset featuring a referring expression segmentation task with referring expressions of occluded objects. OCID-Ref consists of 305,694 referring expressions from 2,300 scenes with providing RGB image and point cloud inputs. To resolve challenging occlusion issues, we argue that it's crucial to take advantage of both 2D and 3D signals to resolve challenging occlusion issues. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregating 2D and 3D signals but referring to occluded objects still remains challenging for the modern visual grounding systems.

### 87.A review of machine learning in processing remote sensing data for mineral exploration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07678.pdf)
>  As a primary step in mineral exploration, a variety of features are mapped such as lithological units, alteration types, structures, and minerals. These features are extracted to aid decision-making in targeting ore deposits. Different types of remote sensing data including satellite optical and radar, airborne, and drone-based data make it possible to overcome problems associated with mapping these important parameters on the field. The rapid increase in the volume of remote sensing data obtained from different platforms has allowed scientists to develop advanced, innovative, and powerful data processing methodologies. Machine learning methods can help in processing a wide range of remote sensing data and in determining the relationship between the reflectance continuum and features of interest. Moreover, these methods are robust in processing spectral and ground truth measurements against noise and uncertainties. In recent years, many studies have been carried out by supplementing geological surveys with remote sensing data, and this area is now considered a hotspot in geoscience research. This paper reviews the implementation and adaptation of some popular and recently established machine learning methods for remote sensing data processing and investigates their applications for exploring different ore deposits. Lastly, the challenges and future directions in this critical interdisciplinary field are discussed.      
### 88.Fine-grained MRI Reconstruction using Attentive Selection Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07672.pdf)
>  Compressed sensing (CS) leverages the sparsity prior to provide the foundation for fast magnetic resonance imaging (fastMRI). However, iterative solvers for ill-posed problems hinder their adaption to time-critical applications. Moreover, such a prior can be neither rich to capture complicated anatomical structures nor applicable to meet the demand of high-fidelity reconstructions in modern MRI. Inspired by the state-of-the-art methods in image generation, we propose a novel attention-based deep learning framework to provide high-quality MRI reconstruction. We incorporate large-field contextual feature integration and attention selection in a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework. We demonstrate that the proposed model can produce superior results compared to other deep learning-based methods in terms of image quality, and relevance to the MRI reconstruction in an extremely low sampling rate diet.      
### 89.Ensemble Learning with Manifold-Based Data Splitting for Noisy Label Correction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07641.pdf)
>  Label noise in training data can significantly degrade a model's generalization performance for supervised learning tasks. Here we focus on the problem that noisy labels are primarily mislabeled samples, which tend to be concentrated near decision boundaries, rather than uniformly distributed, and whose features should be equivocal. To address the problem, we propose an ensemble learning method to correct noisy labels by exploiting the local structures of feature manifolds. Different from typical ensemble strategies that increase the prediction diversity among sub-models via certain loss terms, our method trains sub-models on disjoint subsets, each being a union of the nearest-neighbors of randomly selected seed samples on the data manifold. As a result, each sub-model can learn a coarse representation of the data manifold along with a corresponding graph. Moreover, only a limited number of sub-models will be affected by locally-concentrated noisy labels. The constructed graphs are used to suggest a series of label correction candidates, and accordingly, our method derives label correction results by voting down inconsistent suggestions. Our experiments on real-world noisy label datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-arts.      
### 90.Early Prediction and Diagnosis of Retinoblastoma Using Deep Learning Techniques  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07622.pdf)
>  Retinoblastoma is the most prominent childhood primary intraocular malignancy that impacts the vision of children and adults worldwide. In contrasting and comparing with adults it is uveal melanoma. It is an aggressive tumor that can fill and destroy the eye and the surrounding structures. Therefore early detection of retinoblastoma in childhood is the key. The major impact of the research is to identify the tumor cells in the retina. Also is to find out the stages of the tumor and its corresponding group. The proposed systems assist the ophthalmologists for accurate prediction and diagnosis of retinoblastoma cancer disease at the earliest. The contribution of the proposed approach is to save the life of infants and the grown-up children from vision impairment. The proposed methodology consists of three phases namely, preprocessing, segmentation, and classification. Initially, the fundus images are preprocessed using the Liner Predictive Decision based Median Filter (LPDMF). It removes the noise introduced in the image due to illumination while capturing or scanning the eye of the patients. The preprocessed images are segmented using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish the foreground tumor cells from the background.      
### 91.Untrained networks for compressive lensless photography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07609.pdf)
>  Compressive lensless imagers enable novel applications in an extremely compact device, requiring only a phase or amplitude mask placed close to the sensor. They have been demonstrated for 2D and 3D microscopy, single-shot video, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging; in each of these cases, a compressive-sensing-based inverse problem is solved in order to recover a 3D data-cube from a 2D measurement. Typically, this is accomplished using convex optimization and hand-picked priors. Alternatively, deep learning-based reconstruction methods offer the promise of better priors, but require many thousands of ground truth training pairs, which can be difficult or impossible to acquire. In this work, we propose the use of untrained networks for compressive image recovery. Our approach does not require any labeled training data, but instead uses the measurement itself to update the network weights. We demonstrate our untrained approach on lensless compressive 2D imaging as well as single-shot high-speed video recovery using the camera's rolling shutter, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging. We provide simulation and experimental verification, showing that our method results in improved image quality over existing methods.      
### 92.Student-Teacher Learning from Clean Inputs to Noisy Inputs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07600.pdf)
>  Feature-based student-teacher learning, a training method that encourages the student's hidden features to mimic those of the teacher network, is empirically successful in transferring the knowledge from a pre-trained teacher network to the student network. Furthermore, recent empirical results demonstrate that, the teacher's features can boost the student network's generalization even when the student's input sample is corrupted by noise. However, there is a lack of theoretical insights into why and when this method of transferring knowledge can be successful between such heterogeneous tasks. We analyze this method theoretically using deep linear networks, and experimentally using nonlinear networks. We identify three vital factors to the success of the method: (1) whether the student is trained to zero training loss; (2) how knowledgeable the teacher is on the clean-input problem; (3) how the teacher decomposes its knowledge in its hidden features. Lack of proper control in any of the three factors leads to failure of the student-teacher learning method.      
### 93.Mining Artifacts in Mycelium SEM Micrographs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07573.pdf)
>  Mycelium is a promising biomaterial based on fungal mycelium, a highly porous, nanofibrous structure. Scanning electron micrographs are used to characterize its network, but the currently available tools for nanofibrous microstructures do not contemplate the particularities of biomaterials. The adoption of a software for artificial nanofibrous in mycelium characterization adds the uncertainty of imaging artifact formation to the analysis. The reported work combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to automate the identification of artifacts in the mapped pores of mycelium microstructure. <br>Keywords: Machine learning; unsupervised learning; image processing; mycelium; microstructure informatics
