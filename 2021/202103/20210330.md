### 1.High-Fidelity and Arbitrary Face Editing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15814.pdf)
>  Cycle consistency is widely used for face editing. However, we observe that the generator tends to find a tricky way to hide information from the original image to satisfy the constraint of cycle consistency, making it impossible to maintain the rich details (e.g., wrinkles and moles) of non-editing areas. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method named HifaFace to address the above-mentioned problem from two perspectives. First, we relieve the pressure of the generator to synthesize rich details by directly feeding the high-frequency information of the input image into the end of the generator. Second, we adopt an additional discriminator to encourage the generator to synthesize rich details. Specifically, we apply wavelet transformation to transform the image into multi-frequency domains, among which the high-frequency parts can be used to recover the rich details. We also notice that a fine-grained and wider-range control for the attribute is of great importance for face editing. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attribute regression loss. Powered by the proposed framework, we achieve high-fidelity and arbitrary face editing, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches.      
### 2.PixelTransformer: Sample Conditioned Signal Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15813.pdf)
>  We propose a generative model that can infer a distribution for the underlying spatial signal conditioned on sparse samples e.g. plausible images given a few observed pixels. In contrast to sequential autoregressive generative models, our model allows conditioning on arbitrary samples and can answer distributional queries for any location. We empirically validate our approach across three image datasets and show that we learn to generate diverse and meaningful samples, with the distribution variance reducing given more observed pixels. We also show that our approach is applicable beyond images and can allow generating other types of spatial outputs e.g. polynomials, 3D shapes, and videos.      
### 3.LatentKeypointGAN: Controlling GANs via Latent Keypoints  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15812.pdf)
>  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have attained photo-realistic quality. However, it remains an open challenge of how to best control the image content. We introduce LatentKeypointGAN, a two-stage GAN that is trained end-to-end on the classical GAN objective yet internally conditioned on a set of sparse keypoints with associated appearance embeddings that respectively control the position and style of the generated objects and their parts. A major difficulty that we address with suitable network architectures and training schemes is disentangling the image into spatial and appearance factors without any supervision signals of either nor domain knowledge. We demonstrate that LatentKeypointGAN provides an interpretable latent space that can be used to re-arrange the generated images by re-positioning and exchanging keypoint embeddings, such as combining the eyes, nose, and mouth from different images for generating portraits. In addition, the explicit generation of keypoints and matching images enables a new, GAN-based methodology for unsupervised keypoint detection.      
### 4.CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15808.pdf)
>  We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (\ie shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (\ie dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (\eg ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7\% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.

### 5.Adaptive Methods for Real-World Domain Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15796.pdf)
>  Invariant approaches have been remarkably successful in tackling the problem of domain generalization, where the objective is to perform inference on data distributions different from those used in training. In our work, we investigate whether it is possible to leverage domain information from the unseen test samples themselves. We propose a domain-adaptive approach consisting of two steps: a) we first learn a discriminative domain embedding from unsupervised training examples, and b) use this domain embedding as supplementary information to build a domain-adaptive model, that takes both the input as well as its domain into account while making predictions. For unseen domains, our method simply uses few unlabelled test examples to construct the domain embedding. This enables adaptive classification on any unseen domain. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various domain generalization benchmarks. In addition, we introduce the first real-world, large-scale domain generalization benchmark, Geo-YFCC, containing 1.1M samples over 40 training, 7 validation, and 15 test domains, orders of magnitude larger than prior work. We show that the existing approaches either do not scale to this dataset or underperform compared to the simple baseline of training a model on the union of data from all training domains. In contrast, our approach achieves a significant improvement.      
### 6.Affect Analysis in-the-wild: Valence-Arousal, Expressions, Action Units and a Unified Framework  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15792.pdf)
>  Affect recognition based on subjects' facial expressions has been a topic of major research in the attempt to generate machines that can understand the way subjects feel, act and react. In the past, due to the unavailability of large amounts of data captured in real-life situations, research has mainly focused on controlled environments. However, recently, social media and platforms have been widely used. Moreover, deep learning has emerged as a means to solve visual analysis and recognition problems. This paper exploits these advances and presents significant contributions for affect analysis and recognition in-the-wild. Affect analysis and recognition can be seen as a dual knowledge generation problem, involving: i) creation of new, large and rich in-the-wild databases and ii) design and training of novel deep neural architectures that are able to analyse affect over these databases and to successfully generalise their performance on other datasets. The paper focuses on large in-the-wild databases, i.e., Aff-Wild and Aff-Wild2 and presents the design of two classes of deep neural networks trained with these databases. The first class refers to uni-task affect recognition, focusing on prediction of the valence and arousal dimensional variables. The second class refers to estimation of all main behavior tasks, i.e. valence-arousal prediction; categorical emotion classification in seven basic facial expressions; facial Action Unit detection. A novel multi-task and holistic framework is presented which is able to jointly learn and effectively generalize and perform affect recognition over all existing in-the-wild databases. Large experimental studies illustrate the achieved performance improvement over the existing state-of-the-art in affect recognition.      
### 7.Enhanced Boundary Learning for Glass-like Object Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15734.pdf)
>  Glass-like objects such as windows, bottles, and mirrors exist widely in the real world. Sensing these objects has many applications, including robot navigation and grasping. However, this task is very challenging due to the arbitrary scenes behind glass-like objects. This paper aims to solve the glass-like object segmentation problem via enhanced boundary learning. In particular, we first propose a novel refined differential module for generating finer boundary cues. Then an edge-aware point-based graph convolution network module is proposed to model the global shape representation along the boundary. Both modules are lightweight and effective, which can be embedded into various segmentation models. Moreover, we use these two modules to design a decoder to get accurate segmentation results, especially on the boundary. Extensive experiments on three recent glass-like object segmentation datasets, including Trans10k, MSD, and GDD, show that our approach establishes new state-of-the-art performances. We also offer the generality and superiority of our approach compared with recent methods on three general segmentation datasets, including Cityscapes, BDD, and COCO Stuff. Code and models will be available at (\url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/hehao13/EBLNet" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>})      
### 8.Evaluation of Correctness in Unsupervised Many-to-Many Image Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15727.pdf)
>  Given an input image from a source domain and a "guidance" image from a target domain, unsupervised many-to-many image-to-image (UMMI2I) translation methods seek to generate a plausible example from the target domain that preserves domain-invariant information of the input source image and inherits the domain-specific information from the guidance image. For example, when translating female faces to male faces, the generated male face should have the same expression, pose and hair color as the input female image, and the same facial hairstyle and other male-specific attributes as the guidance male image. Current state-of-the art UMMI2I methods generate visually pleasing images, but, since for most pairs of real datasets we do not know which attributes are domain-specific and which are domain-invariant, the semantic correctness of existing approaches has not been quantitatively evaluated yet. In this paper, we propose a set of benchmarks and metrics for the evaluation of semantic correctness of UMMI2I methods. We provide an extensive study how well the existing state-of-the-art UMMI2I translation methods preserve domain-invariant and manipulate domain-specific attributes, and discuss the trade-offs shared by all methods, as well as how different architectural choices affect various aspects of semantic correctness.      
### 9.StyleMeUp: Towards Style-Agnostic Sketch-Based Image Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15706.pdf)
>  Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) is a cross-modal matching problem which is typically solved by learning a joint embedding space where the semantic content shared between photo and sketch modalities are preserved. However, a fundamental challenge in SBIR has been largely ignored so far, that is, sketches are drawn by humans and considerable style variations exist amongst different users. An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this style diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a novel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed. Different from existing models, a cross-modal variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explicitly disentangle each sketch into a semantic content part shared with the corresponding photo, and a style part unique to the sketcher. Importantly, to make our model dynamically adaptable to any unseen user styles, we propose to meta-train our cross-modal VAE by adding two style-adaptive components: a set of feature transformation layers to its encoder and a regulariser to the disentangled semantic content latent code. With this meta-learning framework, our model can not only disentangle the cross-modal shared semantic content for SBIR, but can adapt the disentanglement to any unseen user style as well, making the SBIR model truly style-agnostic. Extensive experiments show that our style-agnostic model yields state-of-the-art performance for both category-level and instance-level SBIR.      
### 10.ViViT: A Video Vision Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15691.pdf)
>  We present pure-transformer based models for video classification, drawing upon the recent success of such models in image classification. Our model extracts spatio-temporal tokens from the input video, which are then encoded by a series of transformer layers. In order to handle the long sequences of tokens encountered in video, we propose several, efficient variants of our model which factorise the spatial- and temporal-dimensions of the input. Although transformer-based models are known to only be effective when large training datasets are available, we show how we can effectively regularise the model during training and leverage pretrained image models to be able to train on comparatively small datasets. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple video classification benchmarks including Kinetics 400 and 600, Epic Kitchens, Something-Something v2 and Moments in Time, outperforming prior methods based on deep 3D convolutional networks. To facilitate further research, we will release code and models.      
### 11.Memory Enhanced Embedding Learning for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15686.pdf)
>  Cross-modal video-text retrieval, a challenging task in the field of vision and language, aims at retrieving corresponding instance giving sample from either modality. Existing approaches for this task all focus on how to design encoding model through a hard negative ranking loss, leaving two key problems unaddressed during this procedure. First, in the training stage, only a mini-batch of instance pairs is available in each iteration. Therefore, this kind of hard negatives is locally mined inside a mini-batch while ignoring the global negative samples among the dataset. Second, there are many text descriptions for one video and each text only describes certain local features of a video. Previous works for this task did not consider to fuse the multiply texts corresponding to a video during the training. In this paper, to solve the above two problems, we propose a novel memory enhanced embedding learning (MEEL) method for videotext retrieval. To be specific, we construct two kinds of memory banks respectively: cross-modal memory module and text center memory module. The cross-modal memory module is employed to record the instance embeddings of all the datasets for global negative mining. To avoid the fast evolving of the embedding in the memory bank during training, we utilize a momentum encoder to update the features by a moving-averaging strategy. The text center memory module is designed to record the center information of the multiple textual instances corresponding to a video, and aims at bridging these textual instances together. Extensive experimental results on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., MSR-VTT and VATEX, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.      
### 12.Adaptive Boosting for Domain Adaptation: Towards Robust Predictions in Scene Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15685.pdf)
>  Domain adaptation is to transfer the shared knowledge learned from the source domain to a new environment, i.e., target domain. One common practice is to train the model on both labeled source-domain data and unlabeled target-domain data. Yet the learned models are usually biased due to the strong supervision of the source domain. Most researchers adopt the early-stopping strategy to prevent over-fitting, but when to stop training remains a challenging problem since the lack of the target-domain validation set. In this paper, we propose one efficient bootstrapping method, called Adaboost Student, explicitly learning complementary models during training and liberating users from empirical early stopping. Adaboost Student combines the deep model learning with the conventional training strategy, i.e., adaptive boosting, and enables interactions between learned models and the data sampler. We adopt one adaptive data sampler to progressively facilitate learning on hard samples and aggregate ``weak'' models to prevent over-fitting. Extensive experiments show that (1) Without the need to worry about the stopping time, AdaBoost Student provides one robust solution by efficient complementary model learning during training. (2) AdaBoost Student is orthogonal to most domain adaptation methods, which can be combined with existing approaches to further improve the state-of-the-art performance. We have achieved competitive results on three widely-used scene segmentation domain adaptation benchmarks.      
### 13.A Model-Based Approach to Synthetic Data Set Generation for Patient-Ventilator Waveforms for Machine Learning and Educational Use  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15684.pdf)
>  Although mechanical ventilation is a lifesaving intervention in the ICU, it has harmful side-effects, such as barotrauma and volutrauma. These harms can occur due to asynchronies. Asynchronies are defined as a mismatch between the ventilator timing and patient respiratory effort. Automatic detection of these asynchronies, and subsequent feedback, would improve lung ventilation and reduce the probability of lung damage. Neural networks to detect asynchronies provide a promising new approach but require large annotated data sets, which are difficult to obtain and require complex monitoring of inspiratory effort. In this work, we propose a model-based approach to generate a synthetic data set for machine learning and educational use by extending an existing lung model with a first-order ventilator model. The physiological nature of the derived lung model allows adaptation to various disease archetypes, resulting in a diverse data set. We generated a synthetic data set using 9 different patient archetypes, which are derived from measurements in the literature. The model and synthetic data quality have been verified by comparison with clinical data, review by a clinical expert, and an artificial intelligence model that was trained on experimental data. The evaluation showed it was possible to generate patient-ventilator waveforms including asynchronies that have the most important features of experimental patient-ventilator waveforms.      
### 14.Generic Attention-model Explainability for Interpreting Bi-Modal and Encoder-Decoder Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15679.pdf)
>  Transformers are increasingly dominating multi-modal reasoning tasks, such as visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results thanks to their ability to contextualize information using the self-attention and co-attention mechanisms. These attention modules also play a role in other computer vision tasks including object detection and image segmentation. Unlike Transformers that only use self-attention, Transformers with co-attention require to consider multiple attention maps in parallel in order to highlight the information that is relevant to the prediction in the model's input. In this work, we propose the first method to explain prediction by any Transformer-based architecture, including bi-modal Transformers and Transformers with co-attentions. We provide generic solutions and apply these to the three most commonly used of these architectures: (i) pure self-attention, (ii) self-attention combined with co-attention, and (iii) encoder-decoder attention. We show that our method is superior to all existing methods which are adapted from single modality explainability.      
### 15.On the Adversarial Robustness of Visual Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15670.pdf)
>  Following the success in advancing natural language processing and understanding, transformers are expected to bring revolutionary changes to computer vision. This work provides the first and comprehensive study on the robustness of vision transformers (ViTs) against adversarial perturbations. Tested on various white-box and transfer attack settings, we find that ViTs possess better adversarial robustness when compared with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We summarize the following main observations contributing to the improved robustness of ViTs: <br>1) Features learned by ViTs contain less low-level information and are more generalizable, which contributes to superior robustness against adversarial perturbations. <br>2) Introducing convolutional or tokens-to-token blocks for learning low-level features in ViTs can improve classification accuracy but at the cost of adversarial robustness. <br>3) Increasing the proportion of transformers in the model structure (when the model consists of both transformer and CNN blocks) leads to better robustness. But for a pure transformer model, simply increasing the size or adding layers cannot guarantee a similar effect. <br>4) Pre-training on larger datasets does not significantly improve adversarial robustness though it is critical for training ViTs. <br>5) Adversarial training is also applicable to ViT for training robust models. <br>Furthermore, feature visualization and frequency analysis are conducted for explanation. The results show that ViTs are less sensitive to high-frequency perturbations than CNNs and there is a high correlation between how well the model learns low-level features and its robustness against different frequency-based perturbations.      
### 16.Unified Graph Structured Models for Video Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15662.pdf)
>  Accurate video understanding involves reasoning about the relationships between actors, objects and their environment, often over long temporal intervals. In this paper, we propose a message passing graph neural network that explicitly models these spatio-temporal relations and can use explicit representations of objects, when supervision is available, and implicit representations otherwise. Our formulation generalises previous structured models for video understanding, and allows us to study how different design choices in graph structure and representation affect the model's performance. We demonstrate our method on two different tasks requiring relational reasoning in videos -- spatio-temporal action detection on AVA and UCF101-24, and video scene graph classification on the recent Action Genome dataset -- and achieve state-of-the-art results on all three datasets. Furthermore, we show quantitatively and qualitatively how our method is able to more effectively model relationships between relevant entities in the scene.      
### 17.Learning Generative Models of Textured 3D Meshes from Real-World Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15627.pdf)
>  Recent advances in differentiable rendering have sparked an interest in learning generative models of textured 3D meshes from image collections. These models natively disentangle pose and appearance, enable downstream applications in computer graphics, and improve the ability of generative models to understand the concept of image formation. Although there has been prior work on learning such models from collections of 2D images, these approaches require a delicate pose estimation step that exploits annotated keypoints, thereby restricting their applicability to a few specific datasets. In this work, we propose a GAN framework for generating textured triangle meshes without relying on such annotations. We show that the performance of our approach is on par with prior work that relies on ground-truth keypoints, and more importantly, we demonstrate the generality of our method by setting new baselines on a larger set of categories from ImageNet - for which keypoints are not available - without any class-specific hyperparameter tuning.      
### 18.GNeRF: GAN-based Neural Radiance Field without Posed Camera  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15606.pdf)
>  We introduce GNeRF, a framework to marry Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Neural Radiance Field reconstruction for the complex scenarios with unknown and even randomly initialized camera poses. Recent NeRF-based advances have gained popularity for remarkable realistic novel view synthesis. However, most of them heavily rely on accurate camera poses estimation, while few recent methods can only optimize the unknown camera poses in roughly forward-facing scenes with relatively short camera trajectories and require rough camera poses initialization. Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly optimization, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms the baselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low textures that are regarded as extremely challenging before.      
### 19.Graph-based Facial Affect Analysis: A Review of Methods, Applications and Challenges  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15599.pdf)
>  Facial affect analysis (FAA) using visual signals is a key step in human-computer interactions. Previous methods mainly focus on extracting appearance and geometry features associated with human affects. However, they do not consider the latent semantic information among each individual facial change, leading to limited performance and generalization. Recent trends attempt to establish a graph-based representation to model these semantic relationships and develop learning framework to leverage it for different FAA tasks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of graph-based FAA, including the evolution of algorithms and their applications. First, we introduce the background knowledge of affect analysis, especially on the role of graph. We then discuss approaches that are widely used for graph-based affective representation in literatures and show a trend towards graph construction. For the relational reasoning in graph-based FAA, we classify existing studies according to their usage of traditional methods or deep models, with a special emphasis on latest graph neural networks. Experimental comparisons of the state-of-the-art on standard FAA problems are also summarized. Finally, we extend the review to the current challenges and potential directions. As far as we know, this is the first survey of graph-based FAA methods, and our findings can serve as a reference point for future research in this field.      
### 20.RobustNet: Improving Domain Generalization in Urban-Scene Segmentation via Instance Selective Whitening  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15597.pdf)
>  Enhancing the generalization performance of deep neural networks in the real world (i.e., unseen domains) is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel instance selective whitening loss to improve the robustness of the segmentation networks for unseen domains. Our approach disentangles the domain-specific style and domain-invariant content encoded in higher-order statistics (i.e., feature covariance) of the feature representations and selectively removes only the style information causing domain shift. As shown in Fig. 1, our method provides reasonable predictions for (a) low-illuminated, (b) rainy, and (c) unexpected new scene images. These types of images are not included in the training dataset that the baseline shows a significant performance drop, contrary to ours. Being simple but effective, our approach improves the robustness of various backbone networks without additional computational cost. We conduct extensive experiments in urban-scene segmentation and show the superiority of our approach over existing work.

### 21.On Development and Evaluation of Retargeting Human Motion and Appearance in Monocular Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15596.pdf)
>  Transferring human motion and appearance between videos of human actors remains one of the key challenges in Computer Vision. Despite the advances from recent image-to-image translation approaches, there are several transferring contexts where most end-to-end learning-based retargeting methods still perform poorly. Transferring human appearance from one actor to another is only ensured when a strict setup has been complied, which is generally built considering their training regime's specificities. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: first, we propose a novel and high-performant approach based on a hybrid image-based rendering technique that exhibits competitive visual retargeting quality compared to state-of-the-art neural rendering approaches. The formulation leverages user body shape into the retargeting while considering physical constraints of the motion in 3D and the 2D image domain. We also present a new video retargeting benchmark dataset composed of different videos with annotated human motions to evaluate the task of synthesizing people's videos, which can be used as a common base to improve tracking the progress in the field. The dataset and its evaluation protocols are designed to evaluate retargeting methods in more general and challenging conditions. Our method is validated in several experiments, comprising publicly available videos of actors with different shapes, motion types and camera setups. The dataset and retargeting code are publicly available to the community at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/retargeting-motion" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 22.MVSNeRF: Fast Generalizable Radiance Field Reconstruction from Multi-View Stereo  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15595.pdf)
>  We present MVSNeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can efficiently reconstruct neural radiance fields for view synthesis. Unlike prior works on neural radiance fields that consider per-scene optimization on densely captured images, we propose a generic deep neural network that can reconstruct radiance fields from only three nearby input views via fast network inference. Our approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo) for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned; this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and substantially less optimization time than NeRF.      
### 23.IA-GCN: Interpretable Attention based Graph Convolutional Network for Disease prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15587.pdf)
>  Interpretability in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) has been explored to some extent in computer vision in general, yet, in the medical domain, it requires further examination. Moreover, most of the interpretability approaches for GCNs, especially in the medical domain, focus on interpreting the model in a post hoc fashion. In this paper, we propose an interpretable graph learning-based model which 1) interprets the clinical relevance of the input features towards the task, 2) uses the explanation to improve the model performance and, 3) learns a population level latent graph that may be used to interpret the cohort's behavior. In a clinical scenario, such a model can assist the clinical experts in better decision-making for diagnosis and treatment planning. The main novelty lies in the interpretable attention module (IAM), which directly operates on multi-modal features. Our IAM learns the attention for each feature based on the unique interpretability-specific losses. We show the application on two publicly available datasets, Tadpole and UKBB, for three tasks of disease, age, and gender prediction. Our proposed model shows superior performance with respect to compared methods with an increase in an average accuracy of 3.2% for Tadpole, 1.6% for UKBB Gender, and 2% for the UKBB Age prediction task. Further, we show exhaustive validation and clinical interpretation of our results.      
### 24.Video Classification with FineCoarse Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15584.pdf)
>  A rich representation of the information in video data can be realized by means of frequency analysis. Fine motion details from the boundaries of moving regions are characterized by high frequencies in the spatio-temporal domain. Meanwhile, lower frequencies are encoded with coarse information containing substantial redundancy, which causes low efficiency for those video models that take as input raw RGB frames. In this work, we propose a Motion Band-pass Module (MBPM) for separating the fine-grained information from coarse information in raw video data. By representing the coarse information with low resolution, we can increase the efficiency of video data processing. By embedding the MBPM into a two-pathway CNN architecture, we define a FineCoarse network. The efficiency of the FineCoarse network is determined by avoiding the redundancy in the feature space processed by the two pathways: one operates on downsampled features of low-resolution data, while the other operates on the fine-grained motion information captured by the MBPM. The proposed FineCoarse network outperforms many recent video processing models on Kinetics400, UCF101 and HMDB51. Furthermore, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art with 57.0% top-1 accuracy on Something-Something V1.      
### 25.Classification of Seeds using Domain Randomization on Self-Supervised Learning Frameworks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15578.pdf)
>  The first step toward Seed Phenotyping i.e. the comprehensive assessment of complex seed traits such as growth, development, tolerance, resistance, ecology, yield, and the measurement of pa-rameters that form more complex traits is the identification of seed type. Generally, a plant re-searcher inspects the visual attributes of a seed such as size, shape, area, color and texture to identify the seed type, a process that is tedious and labor-intensive. Advances in the areas of computer vision and deep learning have led to the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) that aid in classification using images. While they classify efficiently, a key bottleneck is the need for an extensive amount of labelled data to train the CNN before it can be put to the task of classification. The work leverages the concepts of Contrastive Learning and Domain Randomi-zation in order to achieve the same. Briefly, domain randomization is the technique of applying models trained on images containing simulated objects to real-world objects. The use of synthetic images generated from a representational sample crop of real-world images alleviates the need for a large volume of test subjects. As part of the work, synthetic image datasets of five different types of seed images namely, canola, rough rice, sorghum, soy and wheat are applied to three different self-supervised learning frameworks namely, SimCLR, Momentum Contrast (MoCo) and Build Your Own Latent (BYOL) where ResNet-50 is used as the backbone in each of the networks. When the self-supervised models are fine-tuned with only 5% of the labels from the synthetic dataset, results show that MoCo, the model that yields the best performance of the self-supervised learning frameworks in question, achieves an accuracy of 77% on the test dataset which is only ~13% less than the accuracy of 90% achieved by ResNet-50 trained on 100% of the labels.      
### 26.HumanGPS: Geodesic PreServing Feature for Dense Human Correspondences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15573.pdf)
>  In this paper, we address the problem of building dense correspondences between human images under arbitrary camera viewpoints and body poses. Prior art either assumes small motion between frames or relies on local descriptors, which cannot handle large motion or visually ambiguous body parts, e.g., left vs. right hand. In contrast, we propose a deep learning framework that maps each pixel to a feature space, where the feature distances reflect the geodesic distances among pixels as if they were projected onto the surface of a 3D human scan. To this end, we introduce novel loss functions to push features apart according to their geodesic distances on the surface. Without any semantic annotation, the proposed embeddings automatically learn to differentiate visually similar parts and align different subjects into an unified feature space. Extensive experiments show that the learned embeddings can produce accurate correspondences between images with remarkable generalization capabilities on both intra and inter subjects.      
### 27.Tracking 6-DoF Object Motion from Events and Frames  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15568.pdf)
>  Event cameras are promising devices for lowlatency tracking and high-dynamic range imaging. In this paper,we propose a novel approach for 6 degree-of-freedom (6-DoF)object motion tracking that combines measurements of eventand frame-based cameras. We formulate tracking from highrate events with a probabilistic generative model of the eventmeasurement process of the object. On a second layer, we refinethe object trajectory in slower rate image frames through directimage alignment. We evaluate the accuracy of our approach inseveral object tracking scenarios with synthetic data, and alsoperform experiments with real data.      
### 28.Contrastive Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15566.pdf)
>  Recently, contrastive self-supervised learning has become a key component for learning visual representations across many computer vision tasks and benchmarks. However, contrastive learning in the context of domain adaptation remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose to extend contrastive learning to a new domain adaptation setting, a particular situation occurring where the similarity is learned and deployed on samples following different probability distributions without access to labels. Contrastive learning learns by comparing and contrasting positive and negative pairs of samples in an unsupervised setting without access to source and target labels. We have developed a variation of a recently proposed contrastive learning framework that helps tackle the domain adaptation problem, further identifying and removing possible negatives similar to the anchor to mitigate the effects of false negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method adapts well, and improves the performance on the downstream domain adaptation task.      
### 29.Drop the GAN: In Defense of Patches Nearest Neighbors as Single Image Generative Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15545.pdf)
>  Single image generative models perform synthesis and manipulation tasks by capturing the distribution of patches within a single image. The classical (pre Deep Learning) prevailing approaches for these tasks are based on an optimization process that maximizes patch similarity between the input and generated output. Recently, however, Single Image GANs were introduced both as a superior solution for such manipulation tasks, but also for remarkable novel generative tasks. Despite their impressiveness, single image GANs require long training time (usually hours) for each image and each task. They often suffer from artifacts and are prone to optimization issues such as mode collapse. In this paper, we show that all of these tasks can be performed without any training, within several seconds, in a unified, surprisingly simple framework. We revisit and cast the "good-old" patch-based methods into a novel optimization-free framework. We start with an initial coarse guess, and then simply refine the details coarse-to-fine using patch-nearest-neighbor search. This allows generating random novel images better and much faster than GANs. We further demonstrate a wide range of applications, such as image editing and reshuffling, retargeting to different sizes, structural analogies, image collage and a newly introduced task of conditional inpainting. Not only is our method faster ($\times 10^3$-$\times 10^4$ than a GAN), it produces superior results (confirmed by quantitative and qualitative evaluation), less artifacts and more realistic global structure than any of the previous approaches (whether GAN-based or classical patch-based).      
### 30.TrafficQA: A Question Answering Benchmark and an Efficient Network for Video Reasoning over Traffic Events  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15538.pdf)
>  Traffic event cognition and reasoning in videos is an important task that has a wide range of applications in intelligent transportation, assisted driving, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we create a novel dataset, TrafficQA (Traffic Question Answering), which takes the form of video QA based on the collected 10,080 in-the-wild videos and annotated 62,535 QA pairs, for benchmarking the cognitive capability of causal inference and event understanding models in complex traffic scenarios. Specifically, we propose 6 challenging reasoning tasks corresponding to various traffic scenarios, so as to evaluate the reasoning capability over different kinds of complex yet practical traffic events. Moreover, we propose Eclipse, a novel Efficient glimpse network via dynamic inference, in order to achieve computation-efficient and reliable video reasoning. The experiments show that our method achieves superior performance while reducing the computation cost significantly.

### 31.Cloth-Changing Person Re-identification from A Single Image with Gait Prediction and Regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15537.pdf)
>  Cloth-Changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims at matching the same person across different locations over a long-duration, e.g., over days, and therefore inevitably meets challenge of changing clothing. In this paper, we focus on handling well the CC-ReID problem under a more challenging setting, i.e., just from a single image, which enables high-efficiency and latency-free pedestrian identify for real-time surveillance applications. Specifically, we introduce Gait recognition as an auxiliary task to drive the Image ReID model to learn cloth-agnostic representations by leveraging personal unique and cloth-independent gait information, we name this framework as GI-ReID. GI-ReID adopts a two-stream architecture that consists of a image ReID-Stream and an auxiliary gait recognition stream (Gait-Stream). The Gait-Stream, that is discarded in the inference for high computational efficiency, acts as a regulator to encourage the ReID-Stream to capture cloth-invariant biometric motion features during the training. To get temporal continuous motion cues from a single image, we design a Gait Sequence Prediction (GSP) module for Gait-Stream to enrich gait information. Finally, a high-level semantics consistency over two streams is enforced for effective knowledge regularization. Experiments on multiple image-based Cloth-Changing ReID benchmarks, e.g., LTCC, PRCC, Real28, and VC-Clothes, demonstrate that GI-ReID performs favorably against the state-of-the-arts.

### 32.Cloud2Curve: Generation and Vectorization of Parametric Sketches  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15536.pdf)
>  Analysis of human sketches in deep learning has advanced immensely through the use of waypoint-sequences rather than raster-graphic representations. We further aim to model sketches as a sequence of low-dimensional parametric curves. To this end, we propose an inverse graphics framework capable of approximating a raster or waypoint based stroke encoded as a point-cloud with a variable-degree Bézier curve. Building on this module, we present Cloud2Curve, a generative model for scalable high-resolution vector sketches that can be trained end-to-end using point-cloud data alone. As a consequence, our model is also capable of deterministic vectorization which can map novel raster or waypoint based sketches to their corresponding high-resolution scalable Bézier equivalent. We evaluate the generation and vectorization capabilities of our model on Quick, Draw! and K-MNIST datasets.      
### 33.An Adversarial Human Pose Estimation Network Injected with Graph Structure  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15534.pdf)
>  Because of the invisible human keypoints in images caused by illumination, occlusion and overlap, it is likely to produce unreasonable human pose prediction for most of the current human pose estimation methods. In this paper, we design a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) to improve the localization accuracy of visible joints when some joints are invisible. The network consists of two simple but efficient modules, Cascade Feature Network (CFN) and Graph Structure Network (GSN). First, the CFN utilizes the prediction maps from the previous stages to guide the prediction maps in the next stage to produce accurate human pose. Second, the GSN is designed to contribute to the localization of invisible joints by passing message among different joints. According to GAN, if the prediction pose produced by the generator G cannot be distinguished by the discriminator D, the generator network G has successfully obtained the underlying dependence of human joints. We conduct experiments on three widely used human pose estimation benchmark datasets, LSP, MPII and COCO, whose results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.      
### 34.Context Modeling in 3D Human Pose Estimation: A Unified Perspective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15507.pdf)
>  Estimating 3D human pose from a single image suffers from severe ambiguity since multiple 3D joint configurations may have the same 2D projection. The state-of-the-art methods often rely on context modeling methods such as pictorial structure model (PSM) or graph neural network (GNN) to reduce ambiguity. However, there is no study that rigorously compares them side by side. So we first present a general formula for context modeling in which both PSM and GNN are its special cases. By comparing the two methods, we found that the end-to-end training scheme in GNN and the limb length constraints in PSM are two complementary factors to improve results. To combine their advantages, we propose ContextPose based on attention mechanism that allows enforcing soft limb length constraints in a deep network. The approach effectively reduces the chance of getting absurd 3D pose estimates with incorrect limb lengths and achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets. More importantly, the introduction of limb length constraints into deep networks enables the approach to achieve much better generalization performance.      
### 35.Remote Sensing Image Translation via Style-Based Recalibration Module and Improved Style Discriminator  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15502.pdf)
>  Existing remote sensing change detection methods are heavily affected by seasonal variation. Since vegetation colors are different between winter and summer, such variations are inclined to be falsely detected as changes. In this letter, we proposed an image translation method to solve the problem. A style-based recalibration module is introduced to capture seasonal features effectively. Then, a new style discriminator is designed to improve the translation performance. The discriminator can not only produce a decision for the fake or real sample, but also return a style vector according to the channel-wise correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on season-varying dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively perform image translation, thereby consistently improving the season-varying image change detection performance.

### 36.Structure of Multiple Mirror System from Kaleidoscopic Projections of Single 3D Point  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15501.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a novel algorithm of discovering the structure of a kaleidoscopic imaging system that consists of multiple planar mirrors and a camera. The kaleidoscopic imaging system can be recognized as the virtual multi-camera system and has strong advantages in that the virtual cameras are strictly synchronized and have the same intrinsic parameters. In this paper, we focus on the extrinsic calibration of the virtual multi-camera system. The problems to be solved in this paper are two-fold. The first problem is to identify to which mirror chamber each of the 2D projections of mirrored 3D points belongs. The second problem is to estimate all mirror parameters, i.e., normals, and distances of the mirrors. The key contribution of this paper is to propose novel algorithms for these problems using a single 3D point of unknown geometry by utilizing a kaleidoscopic projection constraint, which is an epipolar constraint on mirror reflections. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm of chamber assignment and estimation of mirror parameters with qualitative and quantitative evaluations using synthesized and real data.      
### 37.Tracking Based Semi-Automatic Annotation for Scene Text Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15488.pdf)
>  Recently, video scene text detection has received increasing attention due to its comprehensive applications. However, the lack of annotated scene text video datasets has become one of the most important problems, which hinders the development of video scene text detection. The existing scene text video datasets are not large-scale due to the expensive cost caused by manual labeling. In addition, the text instances in these datasets are too clear to be a challenge. To address the above issues, we propose a tracking based semi-automatic labeling strategy for scene text videos in this paper. We get semi-automatic scene text annotation by labeling manually for the first frame and tracking automatically for the subsequent frames, which avoid the huge cost of manual labeling. Moreover, a paired low-quality scene text video dataset named Text-RBL is proposed, consisting of raw videos, blurry videos, and low-resolution videos, labeled by the proposed convenient semi-automatic labeling strategy. Through an averaging operation and bicubic down-sampling operation over the raw videos, we can efficiently obtain blurry videos and low-resolution videos paired with raw videos separately. To verify the effectiveness of Text-RBL, we propose a baseline model combined with the text detector and tracker for video scene text detection. Moreover, a failure detection scheme is designed to alleviate the baseline model drift issue caused by complex scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Text-RBL with paired low-quality videos labeled by the semi-automatic method can significantly improve the performance of the text detector in low-quality scenes.      
### 38.Adaptive Surface Normal Constraint for Depth Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15483.pdf)
>  We present a novel method for single image depth estimation using surface normal constraints. Existing depth estimation methods either suffer from the lack of geometric constraints, or are limited to the difficulty of reliably capturing geometric context, which leads to a bottleneck of depth estimation quality. We therefore introduce a simple yet effective method, named Adaptive Surface Normal (ASN) constraint, to effectively correlate the depth estimation with geometric consistency. Our key idea is to adaptively determine the reliable local geometry from a set of randomly sampled candidates to derive surface normal constraint, for which we measure the consistency of the geometric contextual features. As a result, our method can faithfully reconstruct the 3D geometry and is robust to local shape variations, such as boundaries, sharp corners and noises. We conduct extensive evaluations and comparisons using public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and has superior efficiency and robustness.      
### 39.PeaceGAN: A GAN-based Multi-Task Learning Method for SAR Target Image Generation with a Pose Estimator and an Auxiliary Classifier  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15469.pdf)
>  Although Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are successfully applied to diverse fields, training GANs on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is a challenging task mostly due to speckle noise. On the one hands, in a learning perspective of human's perception, it is natural to learn a task by using various information from multiple sources. However, in the previous GAN works on SAR target image generation, the information on target classes has only been used. Due to the backscattering characteristics of SAR image signals, the shapes and structures of SAR target images are strongly dependent on their pose angles. Nevertheless, the pose angle information has not been incorporated into such generative models for SAR target images. In this paper, we firstly propose a novel GAN-based multi-task learning (MTL) method for SAR target image generation, called PeaceGAN that uses both pose angle and target class information, which makes it possible to produce SAR target images of desired target classes at intended pose angles. For this, the PeaceGAN has two additional structures, a pose estimator and an auxiliary classifier, at the side of its discriminator to combine the pose and class information more efficiently. In addition, the PeaceGAN is jointly learned in an end-to-end manner as MTL with both pose angle and target class information, thus enhancing the diversity and quality of generated SAR target images The extensive experiments show that taking an advantage of both pose angle and target class learning by the proposed pose estimator and auxiliary classifier can help the PeaceGAN's generator effectively learn the distributions of SAR target images in the MTL framework, so that it can better generate the SAR target images more flexibly and faithfully at intended pose angles for desired target classes compared to the recent state-of-the-art methods.      
### 40.Get away from Style: Category-Guided Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15467.pdf)
>  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) becomes more and more popular in tackling real-world problems without ground truth of the target domain. Though a mass of tedious annotation work is not needed, UDA unavoidably faces the problem how to narrow the domain discrepancy to boost the transferring performance. In this paper, we focus on UDA for semantic segmentation task. Firstly, we propose a style-independent content feature extraction mechanism to keep the style information of extracted features in the similar space, since the style information plays a extremely slight role for semantic segmentation compared with the content part. Secondly, to keep the balance of pseudo labels on each category, we propose a category-guided threshold mechanism to choose category-wise pseudo labels for self-supervised learning. The experiments are conducted using GTA5 as the source domain, Cityscapes as the target domain. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-arts with a noticeable gain on cross-domain adaptation tasks.      
### 41.A Hierarchical Approach to Remote Sensing Scene Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15463.pdf)
>  Remote sensing scene classification deals with the problem of classifying land use/cover of a region from images. To predict the development and socioeconomic structures of cities, the status of land use in regions are tracked by the national mapping agencies of countries. Many of these agencies use land use types that are arranged in multiple levels. In this paper, we examined the efficiency of a hierarchically designed CNN based framework that is suitable for such arrangements. We use NWPU-RESISC45 dataset for our experiments and arranged this data set in a two level nested hierarchy. We have two cascaded deep CNN models initiated using DenseNet-121 architectures. We provide detailed empirical analysis to compare the performances of this hierarchical scheme and its non hierarchical counterpart, together with the individual model performances. We also evaluated the performance of the hierarchical structure statistically to validate the presented empirical results. The results of our experiments show that although individual classifiers for different sub-categories in the hierarchical scheme perform well, the accumulation of classification errors in the cascaded structure prevents its classification performance from exceeding that of the non hierarchical deep model.      
### 42.Capsule Network is Not More Robust than Convolutional Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15459.pdf)
>  The Capsule Network is widely believed to be more robust than Convolutional Networks. However, there are no comprehensive comparisons between these two networks, and it is also unknown which components in the CapsNet affect its robustness. In this paper, we first carefully examine the special designs in CapsNet that differ from that of a ConvNet commonly used for image classification. The examination reveals five major new/different components in CapsNet: a transformation process, a dynamic routing layer, a squashing function, a marginal loss other than cross-entropy loss, and an additional class-conditional reconstruction loss for regularization. Along with these major differences, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies on three kinds of robustness, including affine transformation, overlapping digits, and semantic representation. The study reveals that some designs, which are thought critical to CapsNet, actually can harm its robustness, i.e., the dynamic routing layer and the transformation process, while others are beneficial for the robustness. Based on these findings, we propose enhanced ConvNets simply by introducing the essential components behind the CapsNet's success. The proposed simple ConvNets can achieve better robustness than the CapsNet.      
### 43.Proxy Synthesis: Learning with Synthetic Classes for Deep Metric Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15454.pdf)
>  One of the main purposes of deep metric learning is to construct an embedding space that has well-generalized embeddings on both seen (training) classes and unseen (test) classes. Most existing works have tried to achieve this using different types of metric objectives and hard sample mining strategies with given training data. However, learning with only the training data can be overfitted to the seen classes, leading to the lack of generalization capability on unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose a simple regularizer called Proxy Synthesis that exploits synthetic classes for stronger generalization in deep metric learning. The proposed method generates synthetic embeddings and proxies that work as synthetic classes, and they mimic unseen classes when computing proxy-based losses. Proxy Synthesis derives an embedding space considering class relations and smooth decision boundaries for robustness on unseen classes. Our method is applicable to any proxy-based losses, including softmax and its variants. Extensive experiments on four famous benchmarks in image retrieval tasks demonstrate that Proxy Synthesis significantly boosts the performance of proxy-based losses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.      
### 44.Automated freezing of gait assessment with marker-based motion capture and deep learning approaches expert-level detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15449.pdf)
>  Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common and debilitating gait impairment in Parkinson's disease. Further insight in this phenomenon is hampered by the difficulty to objectively assess FOG. To meet this clinical need, this paper proposes a motion capture-based FOG assessment method driven by a novel deep neural network. The proposed network, termed multi-stage graph convolutional network (MS-GCN), combines the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) and the multi-stage temporal convolutional network (MS-TCN). The ST-GCN captures the hierarchical motion among the optical markers inherent to motion capture, while the multi-stage component reduces over-segmentation errors by refining the predictions over multiple stages. The proposed model was validated on a dataset of fourteen freezers, fourteen non-freezers, and fourteen healthy control subjects. The experiments indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. An in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis demonstrates that the proposed model is able to achieve clinician-like FOG assessment. The proposed MS-GCN can provide an automated and objective alternative to labor-intensive clinician-based FOG assessment.      
### 45.Deep Image Compositing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15446.pdf)
>  In image editing, the most common task is pasting objects from one image to the other and then eventually adjusting the manifestation of the foreground object with the background object. This task is called image compositing. But image compositing is a challenging problem that requires professional editing skills and a considerable amount of time. Not only these professionals are expensive to hire, but the tools (like Adobe Photoshop) used for doing such tasks are also expensive to purchase making the overall task of image compositing difficult for people without this skillset. In this work, we aim to cater to this problem by making composite images look realistic. To achieve this, we are using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANS). By training the network with a diverse range of filters applied to the images and special loss functions, the model is able to decode the color histogram of the foreground and background part of the image and also learns to blend the foreground object with the background. The hue and saturation values of the image play an important role as discussed in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses GANs for the task of image compositing. Currently, there is no benchmark dataset available for image compositing. So we created the dataset and will also make the dataset publicly available for benchmarking. Experimental results on this dataset show that our method outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods.      
### 46.CNN-based search model underestimates attention guidance by simple visual features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15439.pdf)
>  Recently, Zhang et al. (2018) proposed an interesting model of attention guidance that uses visual features learnt by convolutional neural networks for object recognition. I adapted this model for search experiments with accuracy as the measure of performance. Simulation of our previously published feature and conjunction search experiments revealed that CNN-based search model considerably underestimates human attention guidance by simple visual features. A simple explanation is that the model has no bottom-up guidance of attention. Another view might be that standard CNNs do not learn features required for human-like attention guidance.      
### 47.Learning to Predict Salient Faces: A Novel Visual-Audio Saliency Model  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15438.pdf)
>  Recently, video streams have occupied a large proportion of Internet traffic, most of which contain human faces. Hence, it is necessary to predict saliency on multiple-face videos, which can provide attention cues for many content based applications. However, most of multiple-face saliency prediction works only consider visual information and ignore audio, which is not consistent with the naturalistic scenarios. Several behavioral studies have established that sound influences human attention, especially during the speech turn-taking in multiple-face videos. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate such influences by establishing a large-scale eye-tracking database of Multiple-face Video in Visual-Audio condition (MVVA). Inspired by the findings of our investigation, we propose a novel multi-modal video saliency model consisting of three branches: visual, audio and face. The visual branch takes the RGB frames as the input and encodes them into visual feature maps. The audio and face branches encode the audio signal and multiple cropped faces, respectively. A fusion module is introduced to integrate the information from three modalities, and to generate the final saliency map. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms 11 state-of-the-art saliency prediction works. It performs closer to human multi-modal attention.      
### 48.Transformer Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15436.pdf)
>  Correlation acts as a critical role in the tracking field, especially in recent popular Siamese-based trackers. The correlation operation is a simple fusion manner to consider the similarity between the template and the search region. However, the correlation operation itself is a local linear matching process, leading to lose semantic information and fall into local optimum easily, which may be the bottleneck of designing high-accuracy tracking algorithms. Is there any better feature fusion method than correlation? To address this issue, inspired by Transformer, this work presents a novel attention-based feature fusion network, which effectively combines the template and search region features solely using attention. Specifically, the proposed method includes an ego-context augment module based on self-attention and a cross-feature augment module based on cross-attention. Finally, we present a Transformer tracking (named TransT) method based on the Siamese-like feature extraction backbone, the designed attention-based fusion mechanism, and the classification and regression head. Experiments show that our TransT achieves very promising results on six challenging datasets, especially on large-scale LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10k benchmarks. Our tracker runs at approximatively 50 fps on GPU.

### 49.Towards High Fidelity Monocular Face Reconstruction with Rich Reflectance using Self-supervised Learning and Ray Tracing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15432.pdf)
>  Robust face reconstruction from monocular image in general lighting conditions is challenging. Methods combining deep neural network encoders with differentiable rendering have opened up the path for very fast monocular reconstruction of geometry, lighting and reflectance. They can also be trained in self-supervised manner for increased robustness and better generalization. However, their differentiable rasterization based image formation models, as well as underlying scene parameterization, limit them to Lambertian face reflectance and to poor shape details. More recently, ray tracing was introduced for monocular face reconstruction within a classic optimization-based framework and enables state-of-the art results. However optimization-based approaches are inherently slow and lack robustness. In this paper, we build our work on the aforementioned approaches and propose a new method that greatly improves reconstruction quality and robustness in general scenes. We achieve this by combining a CNN encoder with a differentiable ray tracer, which enables us to base the reconstruction on much more advanced personalized diffuse and specular albedos, a more sophisticated illumination model and a plausible representation of self-shadows. This enables to take a big leap forward in reconstruction quality of shape, appearance and lighting even in scenes with difficult illumination. With consistent face attributes reconstruction, our method leads to practical applications such as relighting and self-shadows removal. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results show improved accuracy and validity of the approach.      
### 50.PlaneSegNet: Fast and Robust Plane Estimation Using a Single-stage Instance Segmentation CNN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15428.pdf)
>  Instance segmentation of planar regions in indoor scenes benefits visual SLAM and other applications such as augmented reality (AR) where scene understanding is required. Existing methods built upon two-stage frameworks show satisfactory accuracy but are limited by low frame rates. In this work, we propose a real-time deep neural architecture that estimates piece-wise planar regions from a single RGB image. Our model employs a variant of a fast single-stage CNN architecture to segment plane instances. Considering the particularity of the target detected, we propose Fast Feature Non-maximum Suppression (FF-NMS) to reduce the suppression errors resulted from overlapping bounding boxes of planes. We also utilize a Residual Feature Augmentation module in the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Our method achieves significantly higher frame-rates and comparable segmentation accuracy against two-stage methods. We automatically label over 70,000 images as ground truth from the Stanford 2D-3D-Semantics dataset. Moreover, we incorporate our method with a state-of-the-art planar SLAM and validate its benefits.      
### 51.FocusedDropout for Convolutional Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15425.pdf)
>  In convolutional neural network (CNN), dropout cannot work well because dropped information is not entirely obscured in convolutional layers where features are correlated spatially. Except randomly discarding regions or channels, many approaches try to overcome this defect by dropping influential units. In this paper, we propose a non-random dropout method named FocusedDropout, aiming to make the network focus more on the target. In FocusedDropout, we use a simple but effective way to search for the target-related features, retain these features and discard others, which is contrary to the existing methods. We found that this novel method can improve network performance by making the network more target-focused. Besides, increasing the weight decay while using FocusedDropout can avoid the overfitting and increase accuracy. Experimental results show that even a slight cost, 10\% of batches employing FocusedDropout, can produce a nice performance boost over the baselines on multiple datasets of classification, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Tiny Imagenet, and has a good versatility for different CNN models.      
### 52.A Dataset and Benchmark Towards Multi-Modal Face Anti-Spoofing Under Surveillance Scenarios  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15409.pdf)
>  Face Anti-spoofing (FAS) is a challenging problem due to complex serving scenarios and diverse face presentation attack patterns. Especially when captured images are low-resolution, blurry, and coming from different domains, the performance of FAS will degrade significantly. The existing multi-modal FAS datasets rarely pay attention to the cross-domain problems under deployment scenarios, which is not conducive to the study of model performance. To solve these problems, we explore the fine-grained differences between multi-modal cameras and construct a cross-domain multi-modal FAS dataset under surveillance scenarios called GREAT-FASD-S. Besides, we propose an Attention based Face Anti-spoofing network with Feature Augment (AFA) to solve the FAS towards low-quality face images. It consists of the depthwise separable attention module (DAM) and the multi-modal based feature augment module (MFAM). Our model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CASIA-SURF dataset and our proposed GREAT-FASD-S dataset.      
### 53.Self-Supervised Visibility Learning for Novel View Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15407.pdf)
>  We address the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from a few sparse source view images. Conventional image-based rendering methods estimate scene geometry and synthesize novel views in two separate steps. However, erroneous geometry estimation will decrease NVS performance as view synthesis highly depends on the quality of estimated scene geometry. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end NVS framework to eliminate the error propagation issue. To be specific, we construct a volume under the target view and design a source-view visibility estimation (SVE) module to determine the visibility of the target-view voxels in each source view. Next, we aggregate the visibility of all source views to achieve a consensus volume. Each voxel in the consensus volume indicates a surface existence probability. Then, we present a soft ray-casting (SRC) mechanism to find the most front surface in the target view (i.e. depth). Specifically, our SRC traverses the consensus volume along viewing rays and then estimates a depth probability distribution. We then warp and aggregate source view pixels to synthesize a novel view based on the estimated source-view visibility and target-view depth. At last, our network is trained in an end-to-end self-supervised fashion, thus significantly alleviating error accumulation in view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates novel views in higher quality compared to the state-of-the-art.      
### 54.Mining Latent Classes for Few-shot Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15402.pdf)
>  Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment unseen classes given only a few annotated samples. Existing methods suffer the problem of feature undermining, i.e. potential novel classes are treated as background during training phase. Our method aims to alleviate this problem and enhance the feature embedding on latent novel classes. In our work, we propose a novel joint-training framework. Based on conventional episodic training on support-query pairs, we add an additional mining branch that exploits latent novel classes via transferable sub-clusters, and a new rectification technique on both background and foreground categories to enforce more stable prototypes. Over and above that, our transferable sub-cluster has the ability to leverage extra unlabeled data for further feature enhancement. Extensive experiments on two FSS benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of 3.7% mIOU on PASCAL-5i and 7.0% mIOU on COCO-20i at the cost of 74% fewer parameters and 2.5x faster inference speed.      
### 55.SIENet: Spatial Information Enhancement Network for 3D Object Detection from Point Cloud  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15396.pdf)
>  LiDAR-based 3D object detection pushes forward an immense influence on autonomous vehicles. Due to the limitation of the intrinsic properties of LiDAR, fewer points are collected at the objects farther away from the sensor. This imbalanced density of point clouds degrades the detection accuracy but is generally neglected by previous works. To address the challenge, we propose a novel two-stage 3D object detection framework, named SIENet. Specifically, we design the Spatial Information Enhancement (SIE) module to predict the spatial shapes of the foreground points within proposals, and extract the structure information to learn the representative features for further box refinement. The predicted spatial shapes are complete and dense point sets, thus the extracted structure information contains more semantic representation. Besides, we design the Hybrid-Paradigm Region Proposal Network (HP-RPN) which includes multiple branches to learn discriminate features and generate accurate proposals for the SIE module. Extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark show that our elaborately designed SIENet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.      
### 56.No frame left behind: Full Video Action Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15395.pdf)
>  Not all video frames are equally informative for recognizing an action. It is computationally infeasible to train deep networks on all video frames when actions develop over hundreds of frames. A common heuristic is uniformly sampling a small number of video frames and using these to recognize the action. Instead, here we propose full video action recognition and consider all video frames. To make this computational tractable, we first cluster all frame activations along the temporal dimension based on their similarity with respect to the classification task, and then temporally aggregate the frames in the clusters into a smaller number of representations. Our method is end-to-end trainable and computationally efficient as it relies on temporally localized clustering in combination with fast Hamming distances in feature space. We evaluate on UCF101, HMDB51, Breakfast, and Something-Something V1 and V2, where we compare favorably to existing heuristic frame sampling methods.      
### 57.Selective Output Smoothing Regularization: Regularize Neural Networks by Softening Output Distributions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15383.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose Selective Output Smoothing Regularization, a novel regularization method for training the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Inspired by the diverse effects on training from different samples, Selective Output Smoothing Regularization improves the performance by encouraging the model to produce equal logits on incorrect classes when dealing with samples that the model classifies correctly and over-confidently. This plug-and-play regularization method can be conveniently incorporated into almost any CNN-based project without extra hassle. Extensive experiments have shown that Selective Output Smoothing Regularization consistently achieves significant improvement in image classification benchmarks, such as CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet, and CUB-200-2011. Particularly, our method obtains 77.30$\%$ accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, which gains 1.1$\%$ than baseline (76.2$\%$). We also empirically demonstrate the ability of our method to make further improvements when combining with other widely used regularization techniques. On Pascal detection, using the SOSR-trained ImageNet classifier as the pretrained model leads to better detection performances. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in small sample size problem and imbalanced dataset problem.      
### 58.AlignMix: Improving representation by interpolating aligned features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15375.pdf)
>  Mixup is a powerful data augmentation method that interpolates between two or more examples in the input or feature space and between the corresponding target labels. Many recent mixup methods focus on cutting and pasting two or more objects into one image, which is more about efficient processing than interpolation. However, how to best interpolate images is not well defined. In this sense, mixup has been connected to autoencoders, because often autoencoders "interpolate well", for instance generating an image that continuously deforms into another. <br>In this work, we revisit mixup from the interpolation perspective and introduce AlignMix, where we geometrically align two images in the feature space. The correspondences allow us to interpolate between two sets of features, while keeping the locations of one set. Interestingly, this gives rise to a situation where mixup retains mostly the geometry or pose of one image and the texture of the other, connecting it to style transfer. More than that, we show that an autoencoder can still improve representation learning under mixup, without the classifier ever seeing decoded images. AlignMix outperforms state-of-the-art mixup methods on five different benchmarks.      
### 59.Contextual Scene Augmentation and Synthesis via GSACNet  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15369.pdf)
>  Indoor scene augmentation has become an emerging topic in the field of computer vision and graphics with applications in augmented and virtual reality. However, current state-of-the-art systems using deep neural networks require large datasets for training. In this paper we introduce GSACNet, a contextual scene augmentation system that can be trained with limited scene priors. GSACNet utilizes a novel parametric data augmentation method combined with a Graph Attention and Siamese network architecture followed by an Autoencoder network to facilitate training with small datasets. We show the effectiveness of our proposed system by conducting ablation and comparative studies with alternative systems on the Matterport3D dataset. Our results indicate that our scene augmentation outperforms prior art in scene synthesis with limited scene priors available.      
### 60.Attention-guided Image Compression by Deep Reconstruction of Compressive Sensed Saliency Skeleton  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15368.pdf)
>  We propose a deep learning system for attention-guided dual-layer image compression (AGDL). In the AGDL compression system, an image is encoded into two layers, a base layer and an attention-guided refinement layer. Unlike the existing ROI image compression methods that spend an extra bit budget equally on all pixels in ROI, AGDL employs a CNN module to predict those pixels on and near a saliency sketch within ROI that are critical to perceptual quality. Only the critical pixels are further sampled by compressive sensing (CS) to form a very compact refinement layer. Another novel CNN method is developed to jointly decode the two compression layers for a much refined reconstruction, while strictly satisfying the transmitted CS constraints on perceptually critical pixels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AGDL system advances the state of the art in perception-aware image compression.      
### 61.Visual Distant Supervision for Scene Graph Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15365.pdf)
>  Scene graph generation aims to identify objects and their relations in images, providing structured image representations that can facilitate numerous applications in computer vision. However, scene graph models usually require supervised learning on large quantities of labeled data with intensive human annotation. In this work, we propose visual distant supervision, a novel paradigm of visual relation learning, which can train scene graph models without any human-labeled data. The intuition is that by aligning commonsense knowledge bases and images, we can automatically create large-scale labeled data to provide distant supervision for visual relation learning. To alleviate the noise in distantly labeled data, we further propose a framework that iteratively estimates the probabilistic relation labels and eliminates the noisy ones. Comprehensive experimental results show that our distantly supervised model outperforms strong weakly supervised and semi-supervised baselines. By further incorporating human-labeled data in a semi-supervised fashion, our model outperforms state-of-the-art fully supervised models by a large margin (e.g., 8.6 micro- and 7.6 macro-recall@50 improvements for predicate classification in Visual Genome evaluation). All the data and code will be available to facilitate future research.      
### 62.Multi-Scale Vision Longformer: A New Vision Transformer for High-Resolution Image Encoding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15358.pdf)
>  This paper presents a new Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture Multi-Scale Vision Longformer, which significantly enhances the ViT of \cite{dosovitskiy2020image} for encoding high-resolution images using two techniques. The first is the multi-scale model structure, which provides image encodings at multiple scales with manageable computational cost. The second is the attention mechanism of vision Longformer, which is a variant of Longformer \cite{beltagy2020longformer}, originally developed for natural language processing, and achieves a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of input tokens. A comprehensive empirical study shows that the new ViT significantly outperforms several strong baselines, including the existing ViT models and their ResNet counterparts, and the Pyramid Vision Transformer from a concurrent work \cite{wang2021pyramid}, on a range of vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The models and source code used in this study will be released to public soon.      
### 63.LayoutParser: A Unified Toolkit for Deep Learning Based Document Image Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15348.pdf)
>  Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model configurations complicate the easy reuse of important innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going efforts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper introduces layoutparser, an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applications. The core layoutparser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout detection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility, layoutparser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digitization pipelines. We demonstrate that layoutparser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases. The library is publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://layout-parser.github.io/" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 64.Motion Basis Learning for Unsupervised Deep Homography Estimation with Subspace Projection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15346.pdf)
>  In this paper, we introduce a new framework for unsupervised deep homography estimation. Our contributions are 3 folds. First, unlike previous methods that regress 4 offsets for a homography, we propose a homography flow representation, which can be estimated by a weighted sum of 8 pre-defined homography flow bases. Second, considering a homography contains 8 Degree-of-Freedoms (DOFs) that is much less than the rank of the network features, we propose a Low Rank Representation (LRR) block that reduces the feature rank, so that features corresponding to the dominant motions are retained while others are rejected. Last, we propose a Feature Identity Loss (FIL) to enforce the learned image feature warp-equivariant, meaning that the result should be identical if the order of warp operation and feature extraction is swapped. With this constraint, the unsupervised optimization is achieved more effectively and more stable features are learned. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly proposed components, and results show our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the homography benchmark datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively.      
### 65.POSEFusion: Pose-guided Selective Fusion for Single-view Human Volumetric Capture  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15331.pdf)
>  We propose POse-guided SElective Fusion (POSEFusion), a single-view human volumetric capture method that leverages tracking-based methods and tracking-free inference to achieve high-fidelity and dynamic 3D reconstruction. By contributing a novel reconstruction framework which contains pose-guided keyframe selection and robust implicit surface fusion, our method fully utilizes the advantages of both tracking-based methods and tracking-free inference methods, and finally enables the high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic surface details even in the invisible regions. We formulate the keyframe selection as a dynamic programming problem to guarantee the temporal continuity of the reconstructed sequence. Moreover, the novel robust implicit surface fusion involves an adaptive blending weight to preserve high-fidelity surface details and an automatic collision handling method to deal with the potential self-collisions. Overall, our method enables high-fidelity and dynamic capture in both visible and invisible regions from a single RGBD camera, and the results and experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.      
### 66.Fooling LiDAR Perception via Adversarial Trajectory Perturbation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15326.pdf)
>  LiDAR point clouds collected from a moving vehicle are functions of its trajectories, because the sensor motion needs to be compensated to avoid distortions. When autonomous vehicles are sending LiDAR point clouds to deep networks for perception and planning, could the motion compensation consequently become a wide-open backdoor in those networks, due to both the adversarial vulnerability of deep learning and GPS-based vehicle trajectory estimation that is susceptible to wireless spoofing? We demonstrate such possibilities for the first time: instead of directly attacking point cloud coordinates which requires tampering with the raw LiDAR readings, only adversarial spoofing of a self-driving car's trajectory with small perturbations is enough to make safety-critical objects undetectable or detected with incorrect positions. Moreover, polynomial trajectory perturbation is developed to achieve a temporally-smooth and highly-imperceptible attack. Extensive experiments on 3D object detection have shown that such attacks not only lower the performance of the state-of-the-art detectors effectively, but also transfer to other detectors, raising a red flag for the community.

### 67.Classifying Video based on Automatic Content Detection Overview  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15323.pdf)
>  Video classification and analysis is always a popular and challenging field in computer vision. It is more than just simple image classification due to the correlation with respect to the semantic contents of subsequent frames brings difficulties for video analysis. In this literature review, we summarized some state-of-the-art methods for multi-label video classification. Our goal is first to experimentally research the current widely used architectures, and then to develop a method to deal with the sequential data of frames and perform multi-label classification based on automatic content detection of video.      
### 68.TFPose: Direct Human Pose Estimation with Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15320.pdf)
>  We propose a human pose estimation framework that solves the task in the regression-based fashion. Unlike previous regression-based methods, which often fall behind those state-of-the-art methods, we formulate the pose estimation task into a sequence prediction problem that can effectively be solved by transformers. Our framework is simple and direct, bypassing the drawbacks of the heatmap-based pose estimation. Moreover, with the attention mechanism in transformers, our proposed framework is able to adaptively attend to the features most relevant to the target keypoints, which largely overcomes the feature misalignment issue of previous regression-based methods and considerably improves the performance. Importantly, our framework can inherently take advantages of the structured relationship between keypoints. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MPII datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the state-of-the-art of regression-based pose estimation and perform comparably with the best heatmap-based pose estimation methods.      
### 69.Onfocus Detection: Identifying Individual-Camera Eye Contact from Unconstrained Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15307.pdf)
>  Onfocus detection aims at identifying whether the focus of the individual captured by a camera is on the camera or not. Based on the behavioral research, the focus of an individual during face-to-camera communication leads to a special type of eye contact, i.e., the individual-camera eye contact, which is a powerful signal in social communication and plays a crucial role in recognizing irregular individual status (e.g., lying or suffering mental disease) and special purposes (e.g., seeking help or attracting fans). Thus, developing effective onfocus detection algorithms is of significance for assisting the criminal investigation, disease discovery, and social behavior analysis. However, the review of the literature shows that very few efforts have been made toward the development of onfocus detector due to the lack of large-scale public available datasets as well as the challenging nature of this task. To this end, this paper engages in the onfocus detection research by addressing the above two issues. Firstly, we build a large-scale onfocus detection dataset, named as the OnFocus Detection In the Wild (OFDIW). It consists of 20,623 images in unconstrained capture conditions (thus called ``in the wild'') and contains individuals with diverse emotions, ages, facial characteristics, and rich interactions with surrounding objects and background scenes. On top of that, we propose a novel end-to-end deep model, i.e., the eye-context interaction inferring network (ECIIN), for onfocus detection, which explores eye-context interaction via dynamic capsule routing. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted on the proposed OFDIW dataset to benchmark the existing learning models and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ECIIN.

### 70.LiDAR R-CNN: An Efficient and Universal 3D Object Detector  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15297.pdf)
>  LiDAR-based 3D detection in point cloud is essential in the perception system of autonomous driving. In this paper, we present LiDAR R-CNN, a second stage detector that can generally improve any existing 3D detector. To fulfill the real-time and high precision requirement in practice, we resort to point-based approach other than the popular voxel-based approach. However, we find an overlooked issue in previous work: Naively applying point-based methods like PointNet could make the learned features ignore the size of proposals. To this end, we analyze this problem in detail and propose several methods to remedy it, which bring significant performance improvement. Comprehensive experimental results on real-world datasets like Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI dataset with various popular detectors demonstrate the universality and superiority of our LiDAR R-CNN. In particular, based on one variant of PointPillars, our method could achieve new state-of-the-art results with minor cost. Codes will be released at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/tusimple/LiDAR_RCNN" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a> .      
### 71.Elsa: Energy-based learning for semi-supervised anomaly detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15296.pdf)
>  Anomaly detection aims at identifying deviant instances from the normal data distribution. Many advances have been made in the field, including the innovative use of unsupervised contrastive learning. However, existing methods generally assume clean training data and are limited when the data contain unknown anomalies. This paper presents Elsa, a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection approach that unifies the concept of energy-based models with unsupervised contrastive learning. Elsa instills robustness against any data contamination by a carefully designed fine-tuning step based on the new energy function that forces the normal data to be divided into classes of prototypes. Experiments on multiple contamination scenarios show the proposed model achieves SOTA performance. Extensive analyses also verify the contribution of each component in the proposed model. Beyond the experiments, we also offer a theoretical interpretation of why contrastive learning alone cannot detect anomalies under data contamination.      
### 72.Monocular 3D Vehicle Detection Using Uncalibrated Traffic Cameras through Homography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15293.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a method to extract the position and pose of vehicles in the 3D world from a single traffic camera. Most previous monocular 3D vehicle detection algorithms focused on cameras on vehicles from the perspective of a driver, and assumed known intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. On the contrary, this paper focuses on the same task using uncalibrated monocular traffic cameras. We observe that the homography between the road plane and the image plane is essential to 3D vehicle detection and the data synthesis for this task, and the homography can be estimated without the camera intrinsics and extrinsics. We conduct 3D vehicle detection by estimating the rotated bounding boxes (r-boxes) in the bird's eye view (BEV) images generated from inverse perspective mapping. We propose a new regression target called \textit{tailed~r-box} and a \textit{dual-view} network architecture which boosts the detection accuracy on warped BEV images. Experiments show that the proposed method can generalize to new camera and environment setups despite not seeing imaged from them during training.      
### 73.Transitive Learning: Exploring the Transitivity of Degradations for Blind Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15290.pdf)
>  Being extremely dependent on the iterative estimation and correction of data or models, the existing blind super-resolution (SR) methods are generally time-consuming and less effective. To address it, this paper proposes a transitive learning method for blind SR using an end-to-end network without any additional iterations in inference. To begin with, we analyze and demonstrate the transitivity of degradations, including the widely used additive and convolutive degradations. We then propose a novel Transitive Learning method for blind Super-Resolution on transitive degradations (TLSR), by adaptively inferring a transitive transformation function to solve the unknown degradations without any iterative operations in inference. Specifically, the end-to-end TLSR network consists of a degree of transitivity (DoT) estimation network, a homogeneous feature extraction network, and a transitive learning module. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on blind SR tasks demonstrate that the proposed TLSR achieves superior performance and consumes less time against the state-of-the-art blind SR methods.

### 74.Generalizing to the Open World: Deep Visual Odometry with Online Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15279.pdf)
>  Despite learning-based visual odometry (VO) has shown impressive results in recent years, the pretrained networks may easily collapse in unseen environments. The large domain gap between training and testing data makes them difficult to generalize to new scenes. In this paper, we propose an online adaptation framework for deep VO with the assistance of scene-agnostic geometric computations and Bayesian inference. In contrast to learning-based pose estimation, our method solves pose from optical flow and depth while the single-view depth estimation is continuously improved with new observations by online learned uncertainties. Meanwhile, an online learned photometric uncertainty is used for further depth and pose optimization by a differentiable Gauss-Newton layer. Our method enables fast adaptation of deep VO networks to unseen environments in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments including Cityscapes to KITTI and outdoor KITTI to indoor TUM demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization ability among self-supervised VO methods.      
### 75.Zero-shot Adversarial Quantization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15263.pdf)
>  Model quantization is a promising approach to compress deep neural networks and accelerate inference, making it possible to be deployed on mobile and edge devices. To retain the high performance of full-precision models, most existing quantization methods focus on fine-tuning quantized model by assuming training datasets are accessible. However, this assumption sometimes is not satisfied in real situations due to data privacy and security issues, thereby making these quantization methods not applicable. To achieve zero-short model quantization without accessing training data, a tiny number of quantization methods adopt either post-training quantization or batch normalization statistics-guided data generation for fine-tuning. However, both of them inevitably suffer from low performance, since the former is a little too empirical and lacks training support for ultra-low precision quantization, while the latter could not fully restore the peculiarities of original data and is often low efficient for diverse data generation. To address the above issues, we propose a zero-shot adversarial quantization (ZAQ) framework, facilitating effective discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer from a full-precision model to its quantized model. This is achieved by a novel two-level discrepancy modeling to drive a generator to synthesize informative and diverse data examples to optimize the quantized model in an adversarial learning fashion. We conduct extensive experiments on three fundamental vision tasks, demonstrating the superiority of ZAQ over the strong zero-shot baselines and validating the effectiveness of its main components.

### 76.Bayesian Deep Basis Fitting for Depth Completion with Uncertainty  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15254.pdf)
>  In this work we investigate the problem of uncertainty estimation for image-guided depth completion. We extend Deep Basis Fitting (DBF) for depth completion within a Bayesian evidence framework to provide calibrated per-pixel variance. The DBF approach frames the depth completion problem in terms of a network that produces a set of low-dimensional depth bases and a differentiable least squares fitting module that computes the basis weights using the sparse depths. By adopting a Bayesian treatment, our Bayesian Deep Basis Fitting (BDBF) approach is able to 1) predict high-quality uncertainty estimates and 2) enable depth completion with few or no sparse measurements. We conduct controlled experiments to compare BDBF against commonly used techniques for uncertainty estimation under various scenarios. Results show that our method produces better uncertainty estimates with accurate depth prediction.      
### 77.Rethinking ResNets: Improved Stacking Strategies With High Order Schemes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15244.pdf)
>  Various Deep Neural Network architectures are keeping massive vital records in computer vision. While drawing attention worldwide, the design of the overall structure somehow lacks general guidance. Based on the relationship between DNN design with numerical differential equations, which several researchers observed in recent years, we perform a fair comparison of residual design with higher-order perspectives. We show that the widely used DNN design strategy, constantly stacking a small design, could be easily improved, supported by solid theoretical knowledge and no extra parameters needed. We reorganize the residual design in higher-order ways, which is inspired by the observation that many effective networks could be interpreted as different numerical discretizations of differential equations. The design of ResNet follows a relatively simple scheme which is Euler forward; however, the situation is getting complicated rapidly while stacking. We suppose stacked ResNet is somehow equalled to a higher order scheme, then the current way of forwarding propagation might be relatively weak compared with a typical high-order method like Runge-Kutta. We propose higher order ResNet to verify the hypothesis on widely used CV benchmarks with sufficient experiments. Stable and noticeable rises in performance are observed, convergence and robustness are benefited.      
### 78.Low-Fidelity End-to-End Video Encoder Pre-training for Temporal ActionLocalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15233.pdf)
>  Temporal action localization (TAL) is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing TAL methods rely on pre-training a video encoder through action classification supervision. This results in a task discrepancy problem for the video encoder -- trained for action classification, but used for TAL. Intuitively, end-to-end model optimization is a good solution. However, this is not operable for TAL subject to the GPU memory constraints, due to the prohibitive computational cost in processing long untrimmed videos. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by introducing a novel low-fidelity end-to-end (LoFi) video encoder pre-training method. Instead of always using the full training configurations for TAL learning, we propose to reduce the mini-batch composition in terms of temporal, spatial or spatio-temporal resolution so that end-to-end optimization for the video encoder becomes operable under the memory conditions of a mid-range hardware budget. Crucially, this enables the gradient to flow backward through the video encoder from a TAL loss supervision, favourably solving the task discrepancy problem and providing more effective feature representations. Extensive experiments show that the proposed LoFi pre-training approach can significantly enhance the performance of existing TAL methods. Encouragingly, even with a lightweight ResNet18 based video encoder in a single RGB stream, our method surpasses two-stream ResNet50 based alternatives with expensive optical flow, often by a good margin.      
### 79.ReAgent: Point Cloud Registration using Imitation and Reinforcement Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15231.pdf)
>  Point cloud registration is a common step in many 3D computer vision tasks such as object pose estimation, where a 3D model is aligned to an observation. Classical registration methods generalize well to novel domains but fail when given a noisy observation or a bad initialization. Learning-based methods, in contrast, are more robust but lack in generalization capacity. We propose to consider iterative point cloud registration as a reinforcement learning task and, to this end, present a novel registration agent (ReAgent). We employ imitation learning to initialize its discrete registration policy based on a steady expert policy. Integration with policy optimization, based on our proposed alignment reward, further improves the agent's registration performance. We compare our approach to classical and learning-based registration methods on both ModelNet40 (synthetic) and ScanObjectNN (real data) and show that our ReAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The lightweight architecture of the agent, moreover, enables reduced inference time as compared to related approaches. In addition, we apply our method to the object pose estimation task on real data (LINEMOD), outperforming state-of-the-art pose refinement approaches.      
### 80.Exploiting Local Geometry for Feature and Graph Construction for Better 3D Point Cloud Processing with Graph Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15226.pdf)
>  We propose simple yet effective improvements in point representations and local neighborhood graph construction within the general framework of graph neural networks (GNNs) for 3D point cloud processing. As a first contribution, we propose to augment the vertex representations with important local geometric information of the points, followed by nonlinear projection using a MLP. As a second contribution, we propose to improve the graph construction for GNNs for 3D point clouds. The existing methods work with a k-nn based approach for constructing the local neighborhood graph. We argue that it might lead to reduction in coverage in case of dense sampling by sensors in some regions of the scene. The proposed methods aims to counter such problems and improve coverage in such cases. As the traditional GNNs were designed to work with general graphs, where vertices may have no geometric interpretations, we see both our proposals as augmenting the general graphs to incorporate the geometric nature of 3D point clouds. While being simple, we demonstrate with multiple challenging benchmarks, with relatively clean CAD models, as well as with real world noisy scans, that the proposed method achieves state of the art results on benchmarks for 3D classification (ModelNet40) , part segmentation (ShapeNet) and semantic segmentation (Stanford 3D Indoor Scenes Dataset). We also show that the proposed network achieves faster training convergence, i.e. ~40% less epochs for classification.

### 81.Unified Shape and SVBRDF Recovery using Differentiable Monte Carlo Rendering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15208.pdf)
>  Reconstructing the shape and appearance of real-world objects using measured 2D images has been a long-standing problem in computer vision. In this paper, we introduce a new analysis-by-synthesis technique capable of producing high-quality reconstructions through robust coarse-to-fine optimization and physics-based differentiable rendering. <br>Unlike most previous methods that handle geometry and reflectance largely separately, our method unifies the optimization of both by leveraging image gradients with respect to both object reflectance and geometry. To obtain physically accurate gradient estimates, we develop a new GPU-based Monte Carlo differentiable renderer leveraging recent advances in differentiable rendering theory to offer unbiased gradients while enjoying better performance than existing tools like PyTorch3D and redner. To further improve robustness, we utilize several shape and material priors as well as a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy to reconstruct geometry. We demonstrate that our technique can produce reconstructions with higher quality than previous methods such as COLMAP and Kinect Fusion.      
### 82.Defect-GAN: High-Fidelity Defect Synthesis for Automated Defect Inspection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15158.pdf)
>  Automated defect inspection is critical for effective and efficient maintenance, repair, and operations in advanced manufacturing. On the other hand, automated defect inspection is often constrained by the lack of defect samples, especially when we adopt deep neural networks for this task. This paper presents Defect-GAN, an automated defect synthesis network that generates realistic and diverse defect samples for training accurate and robust defect inspection networks. Defect-GAN learns through defacement and restoration processes, where the defacement generates defects on normal surface images while the restoration removes defects to generate normal images. It employs a novel compositional layer-based architecture for generating realistic defects within various image backgrounds with different textures and appearances. It can also mimic the stochastic variations of defects and offer flexible control over the locations and categories of the generated defects within the image background. Extensive experiments show that Defect-GAN is capable of synthesizing various defects with superior diversity and fidelity. In addition, the synthesized defect samples demonstrate their effectiveness in training better defect inspection networks.      
### 83.Image Processing Techniques for identifying tumors in an MRI image  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15152.pdf)
>  Medical Resonance Imaging or MRI is a medical image processing technique that used radio waves to scan the body. It is a tomographic imaging technique, principally used in the field of radiology. With the advantage of being a painless diagnostic procedure, MRI allows medical personnel to illustrate clear pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes occurring in the body, thus allowing early detection and treatment of diseases. These images, combined with image processing techniques may be used in the detection of tumors, difficult to identify with the naked eye. This digital assignment surveys the different image processing techniques used in Automated Tumor Detection (ATD). This assignment initiates the discussion with a comparison of traditional techniques such as Morphological Tools (MT) and Region Growing Technique (RGT).      
### 84.Bridging the Visual Gap: Wide-Range Image Blending  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15149.pdf)
>  In this paper we propose a new problem scenario in image processing, wide-range image blending, which aims to smoothly merge two different input photos into a panorama by generating novel image content for the intermediate region between them. Although such problem is closely related to the topics of image inpainting, image outpainting, and image blending, none of the approaches from these topics is able to easily address it. We introduce an effective deep-learning model to realize wide-range image blending, where a novel Bidirectional Content Transfer module is proposed to perform the conditional prediction for the feature representation of the intermediate region via recurrent neural networks. In addition to ensuring the spatial and semantic consistency during the blending, we also adopt the contextual attention mechanism as well as the adversarial learning scheme in our proposed method for improving the visual quality of the resultant panorama. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed method is not only able to produce visually appealing results for wide-range image blending, but also able to provide superior performance with respect to several baselines built upon the state-of-the-art image inpainting and outpainting approaches.      
### 85.TransCenter: Transformers with Dense Queries for Multiple-Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15145.pdf)
>  Transformer networks have proven extremely powerful for a wide variety of tasks since they were introduced. Computer vision is not an exception, as the use of transformers has become very popular in the vision community in recent years. Despite this wave, multiple-object tracking (MOT) exhibits for now some sort of incompatibility with transformers. We argue that the standard representation -- bounding boxes -- is not adapted to learning transformers for MOT. Inspired by recent research, we propose TransCenter, the first transformer-based architecture for tracking the centers of multiple targets. Methodologically, we propose the use of dense queries in a double-decoder network, to be able to robustly infer the heatmap of targets' centers and associate them through time. TransCenter outperforms the current state-of-the-art in multiple-object tracking, both in MOT17 and MOT20. Our ablation study demonstrates the advantage in the proposed architecture compared to more naive alternatives. The code will be made publicly available.      
### 86.Face Recognition as a Method of Authentication in a Web-Based System  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15144.pdf)
>  Online information systems currently heavily rely on the username and password traditional method for protecting information and controlling access. With the advancement in biometric technology and popularity of fields like AI and Machine Learning, biometric security is becoming increasingly popular because of the usability advantage. This paper reports how machine learning based face recognition can be integrated into a web-based system as a method of authentication to reap the benefits of improved usability. This paper includes a comparison of combinations of detection and classification algorithms with FaceNet for face recognition. The results show that a combination of MTCNN for detection, Facenet for generating embeddings, and LinearSVC for classification outperforms other combinations with a 95% accuracy. The resulting classifier is integrated into the web-based system and used for authenticating users.      
### 87.Imponderous Net for Facial Expression Recognition in the Wild  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15136.pdf)
>  Since the renaissance of deep learning (DL), facial expression recognition (FER) has received a lot of interest, with continual improvement in the performance. Hand-in-hand with performance, new challenges have come up. Modern FER systems deal with face images captured under uncontrolled conditions (also called in-the-wild scenario) including occlusions and pose variations. They successfully handle such conditions using deep networks that come with various components like transfer learning, attention mechanism and local-global context extractor. However, these deep networks are highly complex with large number of parameters, making them unfit to be deployed in real scenarios. Is it possible to build a light-weight network that can still show significantly good performance on FER under in-the-wild scenario? In this work, we methodically build such a network and call it as Imponderous Net. We leverage on the aforementioned components of deep networks for FER, and analyse, carefully choose and fit them to arrive at Imponderous Net. Our Imponderous Net is a low calorie net with only 1.45M parameters, which is almost 50x less than that of a state-of-the-art (SOTA) architecture. Further, during inference, it can process at the real time rate of 40 frames per second (fps) in an intel-i7 cpu. Though it is low calorie, it is still power packed in its performance, overpowering other light-weight architectures and even few high capacity architectures. Specifically, Imponderous Net reports 87.09\%, 88.17\% and 62.06\% accuracies on in-the-wild datasets RAFDB, FERPlus and AffectNet respectively. It also exhibits superior robustness under occlusions and pose variations in comparison to other light-weight architectures from the literature.      
### 88.Meta-Mining Discriminative Samples for Kinship Verification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15108.pdf)
>  Kinship verification aims to find out whether there is a kin relation for a given pair of facial images. Kinship verification databases are born with unbalanced data. For a database with N positive kinship pairs, we naturally obtain N(N-1) negative pairs. How to fully utilize the limited positive pairs and mine discriminative information from sufficient negative samples for kinship verification remains an open issue. To address this problem, we propose a Discriminative Sample Meta-Mining (DSMM) approach in this paper. Unlike existing methods that usually construct a balanced dataset with fixed negative pairs, we propose to utilize all possible pairs and automatically learn discriminative information from data. Specifically, we sample an unbalanced train batch and a balanced meta-train batch for each iteration. Then we learn a meta-miner with the meta-gradient on the balanced meta-train batch. In the end, the samples in the unbalanced train batch are re-weighted by the learned meta-miner to optimize the kinship models. Experimental results on the widely used KinFaceW-I, KinFaceW-II, TSKinFace, and Cornell Kinship datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.      
### 89.Single Object Tracking through a Fast and Effective Single-Multiple Model Convolutional Neural Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15105.pdf)
>  Object tracking becomes critical especially when similar objects are present in the same area. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches are proposed based on taking a matching network with a heavy structure to distinguish the target from other objects in the area which indeed drastically downgrades the performance of the tracker in terms of speed. Besides, several candidates are considered and processed to localize the intended object in a region of interest for each frame which is time-consuming. In this article, a special architecture is proposed based on which in contrast to the previous approaches, it is possible to identify the object location in a single shot while taking its template into account to distinguish it from the similar objects in the same area. In brief, first of all, a window containing the object with twice the target size is considered. This window is then fed into a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract a region of interest (RoI) in a form of a matrix for each of the frames. In the beginning, a template of the target is also taken as the input to the CNN. Considering this RoI matrix, the next movement of the tracker is determined based on a simple and fast method. Moreover, this matrix helps to estimate the object size which is crucial when it changes over time. Despite the absence of a matching network, the presented tracker performs comparatively with the SOTA in challenging situations while having a super speed compared to them (up to $120 FPS$ on 1080ti). To investigate this claim, a comparison study is carried out on the GOT-10k dataset. Results reveal the outstanding performance of the proposed method in fulfilling the task.      
### 90.BA^2M: A Batch Aware Attention Module for Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15099.pdf)
>  The attention mechanisms have been employed in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance the feature representation. However, existing attention mechanisms only concentrate on refining the features inside each sample and neglect the discrimination between different samples. In this paper, we propose a batch aware attention module (BA2M) for feature enrichment from a distinctive perspective. More specifically, we first get the sample-wise attention representation (SAR) by fusing the channel, local spatial and global spatial attention maps within each sample. Then, we feed the SARs of the whole batch to a normalization function to get the weights for each sample. The weights serve to distinguish the features' importance between samples in a training batch with different complexity of content. The BA2M could be embedded into different parts of CNN and optimized with the network in an end-to-end manner. The design of BA2M is lightweight with few extra parameters and calculations. We validate BA2M through extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K for the image recognition task. The results show that BA2M can boost the performance of various network architectures and outperforms many classical attention methods. Besides, BA2M exceeds traditional methods of re-weighting samples based on the loss value.      
### 91.ACSNet: Action-Context Separation Network for Weakly Supervised Temporal Action Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15088.pdf)
>  The object of Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WS-TAL) is to localize all action instances in an untrimmed video with only video-level supervision. Due to the lack of frame-level annotations during training, current WS-TAL methods rely on attention mechanisms to localize the foreground snippets or frames that contribute to the video-level classification task. This strategy frequently confuse context with the actual action, in the localization result. Separating action and context is a core problem for precise WS-TAL, but it is very challenging and has been largely ignored in the literature. In this paper, we introduce an Action-Context Separation Network (ACSNet) that explicitly takes into account context for accurate action localization. It consists of two branches (i.e., the Foreground-Background branch and the Action-Context branch). The Foreground- Background branch first distinguishes foreground from background within the entire video while the Action-Context branch further separates the foreground as action and context. We associate video snippets with two latent components (i.e., a positive component and a negative component), and their different combinations can effectively characterize foreground, action and context. Furthermore, we introduce extended labels with auxiliary context categories to facilitate the learning of action-context separation. Experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2/v1.3 datasets demonstrate the ACSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art WS-TAL methods by a large margin.      
### 92.Learning a Sketch Tensor Space for Image Inpainting of Man-made Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15087.pdf)
>  This paper studies the task of inpainting man-made scenes. It is very challenging due to the difficulty in preserving the visual patterns of images, such as edges, lines, and junctions. Especially, most previous works are failed to restore the object/building structures for images of man-made scenes. To this end, this paper proposes learning a Sketch Tensor (ST) space for inpainting man-made scenes. Such a space is learned to restore the edges, lines, and junctions in images, and thus makes reliable predictions of the holistic image structures. To facilitate the structure refinement, we propose a Multi-scale Sketch Tensor inpainting (MST) network, with a novel encoder-decoder structure. The encoder extracts lines and edges from the input images to project them into an ST space. From this space, the decoder is learned to restore the input images. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our model. Furthermore, our model can also achieve competitive performance in inpainting general nature images over the competitors.      
### 93.Learning Placeholders for Open-Set Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15086.pdf)
>  Traditional classifiers are deployed under closed-set setting, with both training and test classes belong to the same set. However, real-world applications probably face the input of unknown categories, and the model will recognize them as known ones. Under such circumstances, open-set recognition is proposed to maintain classification performance on known classes and reject unknowns. The closed-set models make overconfident predictions over familiar known class instances, so that calibration and thresholding across categories become essential issues when extending to an open-set environment. To this end, we proposed to learn PlaceholdeRs for Open-SEt Recognition (Proser), which prepares for the unknown classes by allocating placeholders for both data and classifier. In detail, learning data placeholders tries to anticipate open-set class data, thus transforms closed-set training into open-set training. Besides, to learn the invariant information between target and non-target classes, we reserve classifier placeholders as the class-specific boundary between known and unknown. The proposed Proser efficiently generates novel class by manifold mixup, and adaptively sets the value of reserved open-set classifier during training. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.      
### 94.Picasso: A CUDA-based Library for Deep Learning over 3D Meshes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15076.pdf)
>  We present Picasso, a CUDA-based library comprising novel modules for deep learning over complex real-world 3D meshes. Hierarchical neural architectures have proved effective in multi-scale feature extraction which signifies the need for fast mesh decimation. However, existing methods rely on CPU-based implementations to obtain multi-resolution meshes. We design GPU-accelerated mesh decimation to facilitate network resolution reduction efficiently on-the-fly. Pooling and unpooling modules are defined on the vertex clusters gathered during decimation. For feature learning over meshes, Picasso contains three types of novel convolutions namely, facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and facet2facet convolution. Hence, it treats a mesh as a geometric structure comprising vertices and facets, rather than a spatial graph with edges as previous methods do. Picasso also incorporates a fuzzy mechanism in its filters for robustness to mesh sampling (vertex density). It exploits Gaussian mixtures to define fuzzy coefficients for the facet2vertex convolution, and barycentric interpolation to define the coefficients for the remaining two convolutions. In this release, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules with competitive segmentation results on S3DIS. The library will be made public through <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/hlei-ziyan/Picasso" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 95.Attention to Warp: Deep Metric Learning for Multivariate Time Series  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15074.pdf)
>  Deep time series metric learning is challenging due to the difficult trade-off between temporal invariance to nonlinear distortion and discriminative power in identifying non-matching sequences. This paper proposes a novel neural network-based approach for robust yet discriminative time series classification and verification. This approach adapts a parameterized attention model to time warping for greater and more adaptive temporal invariance. It is robust against not only local but also large global distortions, so that even matching pairs that do not satisfy the monotonicity, continuity, and boundary conditions can still be successfully identified. Learning of this model is further guided by dynamic time warping to impose temporal constraints for stabilized training and higher discriminative power. It can learn to augment the inter-class variation through warping, so that similar but different classes can be effectively distinguished. We experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over previous non-parametric and deep models by combining it with a deep online signature verification framework, after confirming its promising behavior in single-letter handwriting classification on the Unipen dataset.      
### 96.ManhattanSLAM: Robust Planar Tracking and Mapping Leveraging Mixture of Manhattan Frames  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15068.pdf)
>  In this paper, a robust RGB-D SLAM system is proposed to utilize the structural information in indoor scenes, allowing for accurate tracking and efficient dense mapping on a CPU. Prior works have used the Manhattan World (MW) assumption to estimate low-drift camera pose, in turn limiting the applications of such systems. This paper, in contrast, proposes a novel approach delivering robust tracking in MW and non-MW environments. We check orthogonal relations between planes to directly detect Manhattan Frames, modeling the scene as a Mixture of Manhattan Frames. For MW scenes, we decouple pose estimation and provide a novel drift-free rotation estimation based on Manhattan Frame observations. For translation estimation in MW scenes and full camera pose estimation in non-MW scenes, we make use of point, line and plane features for robust tracking in challenging scenes. %mapping Additionally, by exploiting plane features detected in each frame, we also propose an efficient surfel-based dense mapping strategy, which divides each image into planar and non-planar regions. Planar surfels are initialized directly from sparse planes in our map while non-planar surfels are built by extracting superpixels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarks for pose estimation, drift and reconstruction accuracy, achieving superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. We will open-source our code in the future.      
### 97.Friends and Foes in Learning from Noisy Labels  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15055.pdf)
>  Learning from examples with noisy labels has attracted increasing attention recently. But, this paper will show that the commonly used CIFAR-based datasets and the accuracy evaluation metric used in the literature are both inappropriate in this context. An alternative valid evaluation metric and new datasets are proposed in this paper to promote proper research and evaluation in this area. Then, friends and foes are identified from existing methods as technical components that are either beneficial or detrimental to deep learning from noisy labeled examples, respectively, and this paper improves and combines technical components from the friends category, including self-supervised learning, new warmup strategy, instance filtering and label correction. The resulting F&amp;F method significantly outperforms existing methods on the proposed nCIFAR datasets and the real-world Clothing1M dataset.      
### 98.HiT: Hierarchical Transformer with Momentum Contrast for Video-Text Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15049.pdf)
>  Video-Text Retrieval has been a hot research topic with the explosion of multimedia data on the Internet. Transformer for video-text learning has attracted increasing attention due to the promising performance.However, existing cross-modal transformer approaches typically suffer from two major limitations: 1) Limited exploitation of the transformer architecture where different layers have different feature characteristics. 2) End-to-end training mechanism limits negative interactions among samples in a mini-batch. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Transformer (HiT) for video-text retrieval. HiT performs hierarchical cross-modal contrastive matching in feature-level and semantic-level to achieve multi-view and comprehensive retrieval results. Moreover, inspired by MoCo, we propose Momentum Cross-modal Contrast for cross-modal learning to enable large-scale negative interactions on-the-fly, which contributes to the generation of more precise and discriminative representations. Experimental results on three major Video-Text Retrieval benchmark datasets demonstrate the advantages of our methods.      
### 99.Distilling Virtual Examples for Long-tailed Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15042.pdf)
>  In this paper, we tackle the long-tailed visual recognition problem from the knowledge distillation perspective by proposing a Distill the Virtual Examples (DiVE) method. Specifically, by treating the predictions of a teacher model as virtual examples, we prove that distilling from these virtual examples is equivalent to label distribution learning under certain constraints. We show that when the virtual example distribution becomes flatter than the original input distribution, the under-represented tail classes will receive significant improvements, which is crucial in long-tailed recognition. The proposed DiVE method can explicitly tune the virtual example distribution to become flat. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, including the large-scale iNaturalist ones, justify that the proposed DiVE method can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, additional analyses and experiments verify the virtual example interpretation, and demonstrate the effectiveness of tailored designs in DiVE for long-tailed problems.      
### 100.LSG-CPD: Coherent Point Drift with Local Surface Geometry for Point Cloud Registration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15039.pdf)
>  Probabilistic point cloud registration methods are becoming more popular because of their robustness. However, unlike point-to-plane variants of iterative closest point (ICP) which incorporate local surface geometric information such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent point drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM components which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method adaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the point-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This results in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point cloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve it with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we demonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations and efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained optimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid transformation of the registration. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various datasets captured with range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs. Also, it is significantly faster than modern implementations of CPD. The code will be released.      
### 101.Noise Injection-based Regularization for Point Cloud Processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15027.pdf)
>  Noise injection-based regularization, such as Dropout, has been widely used in image domain to improve the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, efficient regularization in the point cloud domain is rarely exploited, and most of the state-of-the-art works focus on data augmentation-based regularization. In this paper, we, for the first time, perform systematic investigation on noise injection-based regularization for point cloud-domain DNNs. To be specific, we propose a series of regularization techniques, namely DropFeat, DropPoint and DropCluster, to perform noise injection on the point feature maps at the feature level, point level and cluster level, respectively. We also empirically analyze the impacts of different factors, including dropping rate, cluster size and dropping position, to obtain useful insights and general deployment guidelines, which can facilitate the adoption of our approaches across different datasets and DNN architectures. <br>We evaluate our proposed approaches on various DNN models for different point cloud processing tasks. Experimental results show our approaches enable significant performance improvement. Notably, our DropCluster brings 1.5%, 1.3% and 0.8% higher overall accuracy for PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN, respectively, on ModelNet40 shape classification dataset. On ShapeNet part segmentation dataset, DropCluster brings 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.2% mean Intersection-over-union (IoU) increase for PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN, respectively. On S3DIS semantic segmentation dataset, DropCluster improves the mean IoU of PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN by 3.2%, 2.9% and 3.7%, respectively. Meanwhile, DropCluster also enables the overall accuracy increase for these three popular backbone DNNs by 2.4%, 2.2% and 1.8%, respectively.      
### 102.H-GAN: the power of GANs in your Hands  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15017.pdf)
>  We present HandGAN (H-GAN), a cycle-consistent adversarial learning approach implementing multi-scale perceptual discriminators. It is designed to translate synthetic images of hands to the real domain. Synthetic hands provide complete ground-truth annotations, yet they are not representative of the target distribution of real-world data. We strive to provide the perfect blend of a realistic hand appearance with synthetic annotations. Relying on image-to-image translation, we improve the appearance of synthetic hands to approximate the statistical distribution underlying a collection of real images of hands. H-GAN tackles not only cross-domain tone mapping but also structural differences in localized areas such as shading discontinuities. Results are evaluated on a qualitative and quantitative basis improving previous works. Furthermore, we successfully apply the generated images to the hand classification task.      
### 103.Realistic face animation generation from videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14984.pdf)
>  3D face reconstruction and face alignment are two fundamental and highly related topics in computer vision. Recently, some works start to use deep learning models to estimate the 3DMM coefficients to reconstruct 3D face geometry. However, the performance is restricted due to the limitation of the pre-defined face templates. To address this problem, some end-to-end methods, which can completely bypass the calculation of 3DMM coefficients, are proposed and attract much attention. In this report, we introduce and analyse three state-of-the-art methods in 3D face reconstruction and face alignment. Some potential improvement on PRN are proposed to further enhance its accuracy and speed.      
### 104.Going Deeper Into Face Detection: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14983.pdf)
>  Face detection is a crucial first step in many facial recognition and face analysis systems. Early approaches for face detection were mainly based on classifiers built on top of hand-crafted features extracted from local image regions, such as Haar Cascades and Histogram of Oriented Gradients. However, these approaches were not powerful enough to achieve a high accuracy on images of from uncontrolled environments. With the breakthrough work in image classification using deep neural networks in 2012, there has been a huge paradigm shift in face detection. Inspired by the rapid progress of deep learning in computer vision, many deep learning based frameworks have been proposed for face detection over the past few years, achieving significant improvements in accuracy. In this work, we provide a detailed overview of some of the most representative deep learning based face detection methods by grouping them into a few major categories, and present their core architectural designs and accuracies on popular benchmarks. We also describe some of the most popular face detection datasets. Finally, we discuss some current challenges in the field, and suggest potential future research directions.      
### 105.Labels4Free: Unsupervised Segmentation using StyleGAN  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14968.pdf)
>  We propose an unsupervised segmentation framework for StyleGAN generated objects. We build on two main observations. First, the features generated by StyleGAN hold valuable information that can be utilized towards training segmentation networks. Second, the foreground and background can often be treated to be largely independent and be composited in different ways. For our solution, we propose to augment the StyleGAN2 generator architecture with a segmentation branch and to split the generator into a foreground and background network. This enables us to generate soft segmentation masks for the foreground object in an unsupervised fashion. On multiple object classes, we report comparable results against state-of-the-art supervised segmentation networks, while against the best unsupervised segmentation approach we demonstrate a clear improvement, both in qualitative and quantitative metrics.      
### 106.Panoptic-PolarNet: Proposal-free LiDAR Point Cloud Panoptic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14962.pdf)
>  Panoptic segmentation presents a new challenge in exploiting the merits of both detection and segmentation, with the aim of unifying instance segmentation and semantic segmentation in a single framework. However, an efficient solution for panoptic segmentation in the emerging domain of LiDAR point cloud is still an open research problem and is very much under-explored. In this paper, we present a fast and robust LiDAR point cloud panoptic segmentation framework, referred to as Panoptic-PolarNet. We learn both semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance clustering in a single inference network using a polar Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation, enabling us to circumvent the issue of occlusion among instances in urban street scenes. To improve our network's learnability, we also propose an adapted instance augmentation technique and a novel adversarial point cloud pruning method. Our experiments show that Panoptic-PolarNet outperforms the baseline methods on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets with an almost real-time inference speed. Panoptic-PolarNet achieved 54.1% PQ in the public SemanticKITTI panoptic segmentation leaderboard and leading performance for the validation set of nuScenes.      
### 107.OLED: One-Class Learned Encoder-Decoder Network with Adversarial Context Masking for Novelty Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14953.pdf)
>  Novelty detection is the task of recognizing samples that do not belong to the distribution of the target class. During training, the novelty class is absent, preventing the use of traditional classification approaches. Deep autoencoders have been widely used as a base of many unsupervised novelty detection methods. In particular, context autoencoders have been successful in the novelty detection task because of the more effective representations they learn by reconstructing original images from randomly masked images. However, a significant drawback of context autoencoders is that random masking fails to consistently cover important structures of the input image, leading to suboptimal representations - especially for the novelty detection task. In this paper, to optimize input masking, we have designed a framework consisting of two competing networks, a Mask Module and a Reconstructor. The Mask Module is a convolutional autoencoder that learns to generate optimal masks that cover the most important parts of images. Alternatively, the Reconstructor is a convolutional encoder-decoder that aims to reconstruct unperturbed images from masked images. The networks are trained in an adversarial manner in which the Mask Module generates masks that are applied to images given to the Reconstructor. In this way, the Mask Module seeks to maximize the reconstruction error that the Reconstructor is minimizing. When applied to novelty detection, the proposed approach learns semantically richer representations compared to context autoencoders and enhances novelty detection at test time through more optimal masking. Novelty detection experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets demonstrate the proposed approach's superiority over cutting-edge methods. In a further experiment on the UCSD video dataset for novelty detection, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results.      
### 108.Automated Backend-Aware Post-Training Quantization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14949.pdf)
>  Quantization is a key technique to reduce the resource requirement and improve the performance of neural network deployment. However, different hardware backends such as x86 CPU, NVIDIA GPU, ARM CPU, and accelerators may demand different implementations for quantized networks. This diversity calls for specialized post-training quantization pipelines to built for each hardware target, an engineering effort that is often too large for developers to keep up with. We tackle this problem with an automated post-training quantization framework called HAGO. HAGO provides a set of general quantization graph transformations based on a user-defined hardware specification and implements a search mechanism to find the optimal quantization strategy while satisfying hardware constraints for any model. We observe that HAGO achieves speedups of 2.09x, 1.97x, and 2.48x on Intel Xeon Cascade Lake CPUs, NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPUs, ARM Cortex-A CPUs on Raspberry Pi4 relative to full precision respectively, while maintaining the highest reported post-training quantization accuracy in each case.      
### 109.HDR Video Reconstruction: A Coarse-to-fine Network and A Real-world Benchmark Dataset  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14943.pdf)
>  High dynamic range (HDR) video reconstruction from sequences captured with alternating exposures is a very challenging problem. Existing methods often align low dynamic range (LDR) input sequence in the image space using optical flow, and then merge the aligned images to produce HDR output. However, accurate alignment and fusion in the image space are difficult due to the missing details in the over-exposed regions and noise in the under-exposed regions, resulting in unpleasing ghosting artifacts. To enable more accurate alignment and HDR fusion, we introduce a coarse-to-fine deep learning framework for HDR video reconstruction. Firstly, we perform coarse alignment and pixel blending in the image space to estimate the coarse HDR video. Secondly, we conduct more sophisticated alignment and temporal fusion in the feature space of the coarse HDR video to produce better reconstruction. Considering the fact that there is no publicly available dataset for quantitative and comprehensive evaluation of HDR video reconstruction methods, we collect such a benchmark dataset, which contains $97$ sequences of static scenes and 184 testing pairs of dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our dataset, code and model will be made publicly available.      
### 110.IoU Attack: Towards Temporally Coherent Black-Box Adversarial Attack for Visual Object Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14938.pdf)
>  Adversarial attack arises due to the vulnerability of deep neural networks to perceive input samples injected with imperceptible perturbations. Recently, adversarial attack has been applied to visual object tracking to evaluate the robustness of deep trackers. Assuming that the model structures of deep trackers are known, a variety of white-box attack approaches to visual tracking have demonstrated promising results. However, the model knowledge about deep trackers is usually unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we propose a decision-based black-box attack method for visual object tracking. In contrast to existing black-box adversarial attack methods that deal with static images for image classification, we propose IoU attack that sequentially generates perturbations based on the predicted IoU scores from both current and historical frames. By decreasing the IoU scores, the proposed attack method degrades the accuracy of temporal coherent bounding boxes (i.e., object motions) accordingly. In addition, we transfer the learned perturbations to the next few frames to initialize temporal motion attack. We validate the proposed IoU attack on state-of-the-art deep trackers (i.e., detection based, correlation filter based, and long-term trackers). Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IoU attack method.

### 111.NeMI: Unifying Neural Radiance Fields with Multiplane Images for Novel View Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14910.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose an approach to perform novel view synthesis and depth estimation via dense 3D reconstruction from a single image. Our NeMI unifies Neural radiance fields (NeRF) with Multiplane Images (MPI). Specifically, our NeMI is a general two-dimensional and image-conditioned extension of NeRF, and a continuous depth generalization of MPI. Given a single image as input, our method predicts a 4-channel image (RGB and volume density) at arbitrary depth values to jointly reconstruct the camera frustum and fill in occluded contents. The reconstructed and inpainted frustum can then be easily rendered into novel RGB or depth views using differentiable rendering. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, KITTI and Flowers Light Fields show that our NeMI outperforms state-of-the-art by a large margin in novel view synthesis. We also achieve competitive results in depth estimation on iBims-1 and NYU-v2 without annotated depth supervision.

### 112.Embedding Transfer with Label Relaxation for Improved Metric Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14908.pdf)
>  This paper presents a novel method for embedding transfer, a task of transferring knowledge of a learned embedding model to another. Our method exploits pairwise similarities between samples in the source embedding space as the knowledge, and transfers them through a loss used for learning target embedding models. To this end, we design a new loss called relaxed contrastive loss, which employs the pairwise similarities as relaxed labels for inter-sample relations. Our loss provides a rich supervisory signal beyond class equivalence, enables more important pairs to contribute more to training, and imposes no restriction on manifolds of target embedding spaces. Experiments on metric learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method largely improves performance, or reduces sizes and output dimensions of target models effectively. We further show that it can be also used to enhance quality of self-supervised representation and performance of classification models. In all the experiments, our method clearly outperforms existing embedding transfer techniques.      
### 113.CrossViT: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14899.pdf)
>  The recently developed vision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on image classification compared to convolutional neural networks. Inspired by this, in this paper, we study how to learn multi-scale feature representations in transformer models for image classification. To this end, we propose a dual-branch transformer to combine image patches (i.e., tokens in a transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models. For example, on the ImageNet1K dataset, with some architectural changes, our approach outperforms the recent DeiT by a large margin of 2\%      
### 114.SceneGraphFusion: Incremental 3D Scene Graph Prediction from RGB-D Sequences  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14898.pdf)
>  Scene graphs are a compact and explicit representation successfully used in a variety of 2D scene understanding tasks. This work proposes a method to incrementally build up semantic scene graphs from a 3D environment given a sequence of RGB-D frames. <br>To this end, we aggregate PointNet features from primitive scene components by means of a graph neural network. We also propose a novel attention mechanism well suited for partial and missing graph data present in such an incremental reconstruction scenario. <br>Although our proposed method is designed to run on submaps of the scene, we show it also transfers to entire 3D scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms 3D scene graph prediction methods by a large margin and its accuracy is on par with other 3D semantic and panoptic segmentation methods while running at 35 Hz.      
### 115.Representation, Analysis of Bayesian Refinement Approximation Network: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14896.pdf)
>  After an artificial model background subtraction, the pixels have been labelled as foreground and background. Previous approaches to secondary processing the output for denoising usually use traditional methods such as the Bayesian refinement method. In this paper, we focus on using a modified U-Net model to approximate the result of the Bayesian refinement method and improve the result. In our modified U-Net model, the result of background subtraction from other models will be combined with the source image as input for learning the statistical distribution. Thus, the losing information caused by the background subtraction model can be restored from the source image. Moreover, since the part of the input image is already the output of the other background subtraction model, the feature extraction should be convenient, it only needs to change the labels of the noise pixels. Compare with traditional methods, using deep learning methods superiority in keeping details.      
### 116.An Efficiently Coupled Shape and Appearance Prior for Active Contour Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14887.pdf)
>  This paper proposes a novel training model based on shape and appearance features for object segmentation in images and videos. Whereas most such models rely on two-dimensional appearance templates or a finite set of descriptors, our appearance-based feature is a one-dimensional function, which is efficiently coupled with the object's shape by integrating intensities along the object's iso-contours. Joint PCA training on these shape and appearance features further exploits shape-appearance correlations and the resulting training model is incorporated in an active-contour-type energy functional for recognition-segmentation tasks. Experiments on synthetic and infrared images demonstrate how this shape and appearance training model improves accuracy compared to methods based on the Chan-Vese energy.      
### 117.COVID-19 personal protective equipment detection using real-time deep learning methods  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14878.pdf)
>  The exponential spread of COVID-19 in over 215 countries has led WHO to recommend face masks and gloves for a safe return to school or work. We used artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms for automatic face masks and gloves detection in public areas. We investigated and assessed the efficacy of two popular deep learning algorithms of YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD MobileNet for the detection and proper wearing of face masks and gloves trained over a data set of 8250 images imported from the internet. YOLOv3 is implemented using the DarkNet framework, and the SSD MobileNet algorithm is applied for the development of accurate object detection. The proposed models have been developed to provide accurate multi-class detection (Mask vs. No-Mask vs. Gloves vs. No-Gloves vs. Improper). When people wear their masks improperly, the method detects them as an improper class. The introduced models provide accuracies of (90.6% for YOLO and 85.5% for SSD) for multi-class detection. The systems' results indicate the efficiency and validity of detecting people who do not wear masks and gloves in public.      
### 118.Few-shot Semantic Image Synthesis Using StyleGAN Prior  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14877.pdf)
>  This paper tackles a challenging problem of generating photorealistic images from semantic layouts in few-shot scenarios where annotated training pairs are hardly available but pixel-wise annotation is quite costly. We present a training strategy that performs pseudo labeling of semantic masks using the StyleGAN prior. Our key idea is to construct a simple mapping between the StyleGAN feature and each semantic class from a few examples of semantic masks. With such mappings, we can generate an unlimited number of pseudo semantic masks from random noise to train an encoder for controlling a pre-trained StyleGAN generator. Although the pseudo semantic masks might be too coarse for previous approaches that require pixel-aligned masks, our framework can synthesize high-quality images from not only dense semantic masks but also sparse inputs such as landmarks and scribbles. Qualitative and quantitative results with various datasets demonstrate improvement over previous approaches with respect to layout fidelity and visual quality in as few as one- or five-shot settings.      
### 119.Deep Learning Techniques for In-Crop Weed Identification: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14872.pdf)
>  Weeds are a significant threat to the agricultural productivity and the environment. The increasing demand for sustainable agriculture has driven innovations in accurate weed control technologies aimed at reducing the reliance on herbicides. With the great success of deep learning in various vision tasks, many promising image-based weed detection algorithms have been developed. This paper reviews recent developments of deep learning techniques in the field of image-based weed detection. The review begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of deep learning related to weed detection. Next, recent progresses on deep weed detection are reviewed with the discussion of the research materials including public weed datasets. Finally, the challenges of developing practically deployable weed detection methods are summarized, together with the discussions of the opportunities for future research.We hope that this review will provide a timely survey of the field and attract more researchers to address this inter-disciplinary research problem.      
### 120.Instance segmentation with the number of clusters incorporated in embedding learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14869.pdf)
>  Semantic and instance segmentation algorithms are two general yet distinct image segmentation solutions powered by Convolution Neural Network. While semantic segmentation benefits extensively from the end-to-end training strategy, instance segmentation is frequently framed as a multi-stage task, supported by learning-based discrimination and post-process clustering. Independent optimizations on substages instigate the accumulation of segmentation errors. In this work, we propose to embed prior clustering information into an embedding learning framework FCRNet, stimulating the one-stage instance segmentation. FCRNet relieves the complexity of post process by incorporating the number of clustering groups into the embedding space. The superior performance of FCRNet is verified and compared with other methods on the nucleus dataset BBBC006.      
### 121.TS-CAM: Token Semantic Coupled Attention Map for Weakly Supervised Object Localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14862.pdf)
>  Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging problem when given image category labels but requires to learn object localization models. Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent, causing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty to capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object categories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic attention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the ILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM counterparts by 7.1%/27.1% for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.      
### 122.Video Rescaling Networks with Joint Optimization Strategies for Downscaling and Upscaling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14858.pdf)
>  This paper addresses the video rescaling task, which arises from the needs of adapting the video spatial resolution to suit individual viewing devices. We aim to jointly optimize video downscaling and upscaling as a combined task. Most recent studies focus on image-based solutions, which do not consider temporal information. We present two joint optimization approaches based on invertible neural networks with coupling layers. Our Long Short-Term Memory Video Rescaling Network (LSTM-VRN) leverages temporal information in the low-resolution video to form an explicit prediction of the missing high-frequency information for upscaling. Our Multi-input Multi-output Video Rescaling Network (MIMO-VRN) proposes a new strategy for downscaling and upscaling a group of video frames simultaneously. Not only do they outperform the image-based invertible model in terms of quantitative and qualitative results, but also show much improved upscaling quality than the video rescaling methods without joint optimization. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt at the joint optimization of video downscaling and upscaling.      
### 123.AR Mapping: Accurate and Efficient Mapping for Augmented Reality  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14846.pdf)
>  Augmented reality (AR) has gained increasingly attention from both research and industry communities. By overlaying digital information and content onto the physical world, AR enables users to experience the world in a more informative and efficient manner. As a major building block for AR systems, localization aims at determining the device's pose from a pre-built "map" consisting of visual and depth information in a known environment. While the localization problem has been widely studied in the literature, the "map" for AR systems is rarely discussed. In this paper, we introduce the AR Map for a specific scene to be composed of 1) color images with 6-DOF poses; 2) dense depth maps for each image and 3) a complete point cloud map. We then propose an efficient end-to-end solution to generating and evaluating AR Maps. Firstly, for efficient data capture, a backpack scanning device is presented with a unified calibration pipeline. Secondly, we propose an AR mapping pipeline which takes the input from the scanning device and produces accurate AR Maps. Finally, we present an approach to evaluating the accuracy of AR Maps with the help of the highly accurate reconstruction result from a high-end laser scanner. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to present an end-to-end solution to efficient and accurate mapping for AR applications.      
### 124.Deep Ensemble Collaborative Learning by using Knowledge-transfer Graph for Fine-grained Object Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14845.pdf)
>  Mutual learning, in which multiple networks learn by sharing their knowledge, improves the performance of each network. However, the performance of ensembles of networks that have undergone mutual learning does not improve significantly from that of normal ensembles without mutual learning, even though the performance of each network has improved significantly. This may be due to the relationship between the knowledge in mutual learning and the individuality of the networks in the ensemble. In this study, we propose an ensemble method using knowledge transfer to improve the accuracy of ensembles by introducing a loss design that promotes diversity among networks in mutual learning. We use an attention map as knowledge, which represents the probability distribution and information in the middle layer of a network. There are many ways to combine networks and loss designs for knowledge transfer methods. Therefore, we use the automatic optimization of knowledge-transfer graphs to consider a variety of knowledge-transfer methods by graphically representing conventional mutual-learning and distillation methods and optimizing each element through hyperparameter search. The proposed method consists of a mechanism for constructing an ensemble in a knowledge-transfer graph, attention loss, and a loss design that promotes diversity among networks. We explore optimal ensemble learning by optimizing a knowledge-transfer graph to maximize ensemble accuracy. From exploration of graphs and evaluation experiments using the datasets of Stanford Dogs, Stanford Cars, and CUB-200-2011, we confirm that the proposed method is more accurate than a conventional ensemble method.      
### 125.From Synthetic to Real: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Animal Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14843.pdf)
>  Animal pose estimation is an important field that has received increasing attention in the recent years. The main challenge for this task is the lack of labeled data. Existing works circumvent this problem with pseudo labels generated from data of other easily accessible domains such as synthetic data. However, these pseudo labels are noisy even with consistency check or confidence-based filtering due to the domain shift in the data. To solve this problem, we design a multi-scale domain adaptation module (MDAM) to reduce the domain gap between the synthetic and real data. We further introduce an online coarse-to-fine pseudo label updating strategy. Specifically, we propose a self-distillation module in an inner coarse-update loop and a mean-teacher in an outer fine-update loop to generate new pseudo labels that gradually replace the old ones. Consequently, our model is able to learn from the old pseudo labels at the early stage, and gradually switch to the new pseudo labels to prevent overfitting in the later stage. We evaluate our approach on the TigDog and VisDA 2019 datasets, where we outperform existing approaches by a large margin. We also demonstrate the generalization ability of our model by testing extensively on both unseen domains and unseen animal categories. Our code is available at the project website.      
### 126.Looking Beyond Two Frames: End-to-End Multi-Object Tracking Using Spatial and Temporal Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14829.pdf)
>  Tracking a time-varying indefinite number of objects in a video sequence over time remains a challenge despite recent advances in the field. Ignoring long-term temporal information, most existing approaches are not able to properly handle multi-object tracking challenges such as occlusion. To address these shortcomings, we present MO3TR: a truly end-to-end Transformer-based online multi-object tracking (MOT) framework that learns to handle occlusions, track initiation and termination without the need for an explicit data association module or any heuristics/post-processing. MO3TR encodes object interactions into long-term temporal embeddings using a combination of spatial and temporal Transformers, and recursively uses the information jointly with the input data to estimate the states of all tracked objects over time. The spatial attention mechanism enables our framework to learn implicit representations between all the objects and the objects to the measurements, while the temporal attention mechanism focuses on specific parts of past information, allowing our approach to resolve occlusions over multiple frames. Our experiments demonstrate the potential of this new approach, reaching new state-of-the-art results on multiple MOT metrics for two popular multi-object tracking benchmarks. Our code will be made publicly available.      
### 127.SelfGait: A Spatiotemporal Representation Learning Method for Self-supervised Gait Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14811.pdf)
>  Gait recognition plays a vital role in human identification since gait is a unique biometric feature that can be perceived at a distance. Although existing gait recognition methods can learn gait features from gait sequences in different ways, the performance of gait recognition suffers from insufficient labeled data, especially in some practical scenarios associated with short gait sequences or various clothing styles. It is unpractical to label the numerous gait data. In this work, we propose a self-supervised gait recognition method, termed SelfGait, which takes advantage of the massive, diverse, unlabeled gait data as a pre-training process to improve the representation abilities of spatiotemporal backbones. Specifically, we employ the horizontal pyramid mapping (HPM) and micro-motion template builder (MTB) as our spatiotemporal backbones to capture the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations. Experiments on CASIA-B and OU-MVLP benchmark gait datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SelfGait compared with four state-of-the-art gait recognition methods.

### 128.Face Transformer for Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14803.pdf)
>  Recently there has been great interests of Transformer not only in NLP but also in computer vision. We wonder if transformer can be used in face recognition and whether it is better than CNNs. Therefore, we investigate the performance of Transformer models in face recognition. The models are trained on a large scale face recognition database MS-Celeb-1M and evaluated on several mainstream benchmarks, including LFW, SLLFW, CALFW, CPLFW, TALFW, CFP-FP, AGEDB and IJB-C databases. We demonstrate that Transformer models achieve comparable performance as CNN with similar number of parameters and MACs.      
### 129.A Survey of Orthogonal Moments for Image Representation: Theory, Implementation, and Evaluation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14799.pdf)
>  Image representation is an important topic in computer vision and pattern recognition. It plays a fundamental role in a range of applications towards understanding visual contents. Moment-based image representation has been reported to be effective in satisfying the core conditions of semantic description due to its beneficial mathematical properties, especially geometric invariance and independence. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the orthogonal moments for image representation, covering recent advances in fast/accurate calculation, robustness/invariance optimization, and definition extension. We also create a software package for a variety of widely-used orthogonal moments and evaluate such methods in a same base. The presented theory analysis, software implementation, and evaluation results can support the community, particularly in developing novel techniques and promoting real-world applications.      
### 130.Learning Efficient Photometric Feature Transform for Multi-view Stereo  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14794.pdf)
>  We present a novel framework to learn to convert the perpixel photometric information at each view into spatially distinctive and view-invariant low-level features, which can be plugged into existing multi-view stereo pipeline for enhanced 3D reconstruction. Both the illumination conditions during acquisition and the subsequent per-pixel feature transform can be jointly optimized in a differentiable fashion. Our framework automatically adapts to and makes efficient use of the geometric information available in different forms of input data. High-quality 3D reconstructions of a variety of challenging objects are demonstrated on the data captured with an illumination multiplexing device, as well as a point light. Our results compare favorably with state-of-the-art techniques.      
### 131.CalibDNN: Multimodal Sensor Calibration for Perception Using Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14793.pdf)
>  Current perception systems often carry multimodal imagers and sensors such as 2D cameras and 3D LiDAR sensors. To fuse and utilize the data for downstream perception tasks, robust and accurate calibration of the multimodal sensor data is essential. We propose a novel deep learning-driven technique (CalibDNN) for accurate calibration among multimodal sensor, specifically LiDAR-Camera pairs. The key innovation of the proposed work is that it does not require any specific calibration targets or hardware assistants, and the entire processing is fully automatic with a single model and single iteration. Results comparison among different methods and extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance.      
### 132.Bridging Vision and Language from the Video-to-Text Perspective: A Comprehensive Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14785.pdf)
>  Research in the area of Vision and Language encompasses challenging topics that seek to connect visual and textual information. The video-to-text problem is one of these topics, in which the goal is to connect an input video with its textual description. This connection can be mainly made by retrieving the most significant descriptions from a corpus or generating a new one given a context video. These two ways represent essential tasks for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities, called text retrieval from video task and video captioning/description task. These two tasks are substantially more complex than predicting or retrieving a single sentence from an image. The spatiotemporal information present in videos introduces diversity and complexity regarding the visual content and the structure of associated language descriptions. This review categorizes and describes the state-of-the-art techniques for the video-to-text problem. It covers the main video-to-text methods and the ways to evaluate their performance. We analyze how the most reported benchmark datasets have been created, showing their drawbacks and strengths for the problem requirements. We also show the impressive progress that researchers have made on each dataset, and we analyze why, despite this progress, the video-to-text conversion is still unsolved. State-of-the-art techniques are still a long way from achieving human-like performance in generating or retrieving video descriptions. We cover several significant challenges in the field and discuss future research directions.      
### 133.Equivariant Imaging: Learning Beyond the Range Space  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14756.pdf)
>  In various imaging problems, we only have access to compressed measurements of the underlying signals, hindering most learning-based strategies which usually require pairs of signals and associated measurements for training. Learning only from compressed measurements is impossible in general, as the compressed observations do not contain information outside the range of the forward sensing operator. We propose a new end-to-end self-supervised framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the equivariances present in natural signals. Our proposed learning strategy performs as well as fully supervised methods. Experiments demonstrate the potential of this framework on inverse problems including sparse-view X-ray computed tomography on real clinical data and image inpainting on natural images. Code will be released.      
### 134.Few-Shot Learning for Video Object Detection in a Transfer-Learning Scheme  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14724.pdf)
>  Different from static images, videos contain additional temporal and spatial information for better object detection. However, it is costly to obtain a large number of videos with bounding box annotations that are required for supervised deep learning. Although humans can easily learn to recognize new objects by watching only a few video clips, deep learning usually suffers from overfitting. This leads to an important question: how to effectively learn a video object detector from only a few labeled video clips? In this paper, we study the new problem of few-shot learning for video object detection. We first define the few-shot setting and create a new benchmark dataset for few-shot video object detection derived from the widely used ImageNet VID dataset. We employ a transfer-learning framework to effectively train the video object detector on a large number of base-class objects and a few video clips of novel-class objects. By analyzing the results of two methods under this framework (Joint and Freeze) on our designed weak and strong base datasets, we reveal insufficiency and overfitting problems. A simple but effective method, called Thaw, is naturally developed to trade off the two problems and validate our analysis. <br>Extensive experiments on our proposed benchmark datasets with different scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our novel analysis in this new few-shot video object detection problem.      
### 135.Knowing What VQA Does Not: Pointing to Error-Inducing Regions to Improve Explanation Helpfulness  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14712.pdf)
>  Attention maps, a popular heatmap-based explanation method for Visual Question Answering (VQA), are supposed to help users understand the model by highlighting portions of the image/question used by the model to infer answers. However, we see that users are often misled by current attention map visualizations that point to relevant regions despite the model producing an incorrect answer. Hence, we propose Error Maps that clarify the error by highlighting image regions where the model is prone to err. Error maps can indicate when a correctly attended region may be processed incorrectly leading to an incorrect answer, and hence, improve users' understanding of those cases. To evaluate our new explanations, we further introduce a metric that simulates users' interpretation of explanations to evaluate their potential helpfulness to understand model correctness. We finally conduct user studies to see that our new explanations help users understand model correctness better than baselines by an expected 30% and that our proxy helpfulness metrics correlate strongly ($\rho&gt;0.97$) with how well users can predict model correctness.      
### 136.Focused LRP: Explainable AI for Face Morphing Attack Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14697.pdf)
>  The task of detecting morphed face images has become highly relevant in recent years to ensure the security of automatic verification systems based on facial images, e.g. automated border control gates. Detection methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been shown to be very suitable to this end. However, they do not provide transparency in the decision making and it is not clear how they distinguish between genuine and morphed face images. This is particularly relevant for systems intended to assist a human operator, who should be able to understand the reasoning. In this paper, we tackle this problem and present Focused Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (FLRP). This framework explains to a human inspector on a precise pixel level, which image regions are used by a Deep Neural Network to distinguish between a genuine and a morphed face image. Additionally, we propose another framework to objectively analyze the quality of our method and compare FLRP to other DNN interpretability methods. This evaluation framework is based on removing detected artifacts and analyzing the influence of these changes on the decision of the DNN. Especially, if the DNN is uncertain in its decision or even incorrect, FLRP performs much better in highlighting visible artifacts compared to other methods.      
### 137.Synthesis of Compositional Animations from Textual Descriptions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14675.pdf)
>  "How can we animate 3D-characters from a movie script or move robots by simply telling them what we would like them to do?" "How unstructured and complex can we make a sentence and still generate plausible movements from it?" These are questions that need to be answered in the long-run, as the field is still in its infancy. Inspired by these problems, we present a new technique for generating compositional actions, which handles complex input sentences. Our output is a 3D pose sequence depicting the actions in the input sentence. We propose a hierarchical two-stream sequential model to explore a finer joint-level mapping between natural language sentences and 3D pose sequences corresponding to the given motion. We learn two manifold representations of the motion -- one each for the upper body and the lower body movements. Our model can generate plausible pose sequences for short sentences describing single actions as well as long compositional sentences describing multiple sequential and superimposed actions. We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly available KIT Motion-Language Dataset containing 3D pose data with human-annotated sentences. Experimental results show that our model advances the state-of-the-art on text-based motion synthesis in objective evaluations by a margin of 50%. Qualitative evaluations based on a user study indicate that our synthesized motions are perceived to be the closest to the ground-truth motion captures for both short and compositional sentences.      
### 138.Translate to Adapt: RGB-D Scene Recognition across Domains  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14672.pdf)
>  Scene classification is one of the basic problems in computer vision research with extensive applications in robotics. When available, depth images provide helpful geometric cues that complement the RGB texture information and help to identify more discriminative scene image features. Depth sensing technology developed fast in the last years and a great variety of 3D cameras have been introduced, each with different acquisition properties. However, when targeting big data collections, often multi-modal images are gathered disregarding their original nature. In this work we put under the spotlight the existence of a possibly severe domain shift issue within multi-modality scene recognition datasets. We design an experimental testbed to study this problem and present a method based on self-supervised inter-modality translation able to adapt across different camera domains. Our extensive experimental analysis confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.      
### 139.Rethinking Neural Operations for Diverse Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15798.pdf)
>  An important goal of neural architecture search (NAS) is to automate-away the design of neural networks on new tasks in under-explored domains. Motivated by this broader vision for NAS, we study the problem of enabling users to discover the right neural operations given data from their specific domain. We introduce a search space of neural operations called XD-Operations that mimic the inductive bias of standard multichannel convolutions while being much more expressive: we prove that XD-operations include many named operations across several application areas. Starting with any standard backbone network such as LeNet or ResNet, we show how to transform it into an architecture search space over XD-operations and how to traverse the space using a simple weight-sharing scheme. On a diverse set of applications--image classification, solving partial differential equations (PDEs), and sequence modeling--our approach consistently yields models with lower error than baseline networks and sometimes even lower error than expert-designed domain-specific approaches.      
### 140.Multiscale Clustering of Hyperspectral Images Through Spectral-Spatial Diffusion Geometry  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15783.pdf)
>  Clustering algorithms partition a dataset into groups of similar points. The primary contribution of this article is the Multiscale Spatially-Regularized Diffusion Learning (M-SRDL) clustering algorithm, which uses spatially-regularized diffusion distances to efficiently and accurately learn multiple scales of latent structure in hyperspectral images (HSI). The M-SRDL clustering algorithm extracts clusterings at many scales from an HSI and outputs these clusterings' variation of information-barycenter as an exemplar for all underlying cluster structure. We show that incorporating spatial regularization into a multiscale clustering framework corresponds to smoother and more coherent clusters when applied to HSI data and leads to more accurate clustering labels.      
### 141.[Reproducibility Report] Rigging the Lottery: Making All Tickets Winners  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15767.pdf)
>  \textit{RigL}, a sparse training algorithm, claims to directly train sparse networks that match or exceed the performance of existing dense-to-sparse training techniques (such as pruning) for a fixed parameter count and compute budget. We implement \textit{RigL} from scratch in Pytorch and reproduce its performance on CIFAR-10 within 0.1\% of the reported value. On both CIFAR-10/100, the central claim holds -- given a fixed training budget, \textit{RigL} surpasses existing dynamic-sparse training methods over a range of target sparsities. By training longer, the performance can match or exceed iterative pruning, while consuming constant FLOPs throughout training. We also show that there is little benefit in tuning \textit{RigL}'s hyper-parameters for every sparsity, initialization pair--the reference choice of hyperparameters is often close to optimal performance. Going beyond the original paper, we find that the optimal initialization scheme depends on the training constraint. While the Erdos-Renyi-Kernel distribution outperforms the Uniform distribution for a fixed parameter count, for a fixed FLOP count, the latter performs better. Finally, redistributing layer-wise sparsity while training can bridge the performance gap between the two initialization schemes, but increases computational cost.      
### 142.GnetDet: Object Detection Optimized on a 224mW CNN Accelerator Chip at the Speed of 106FPS  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15756.pdf)
>  Object detection is widely used on embedded devices. With the wide availability of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) accelerator chips, the object detection applications are expected to run with low power consumption, and high inference speed. In addition, the CPU load is expected to be as low as possible for a CNN accelerator chip working as a co-processor with a host CPU. In this paper, we optimize the object detection model on the CNN accelerator chip by minimizing the CPU load. The resulting model is called GnetDet. The experimental result shows that the GnetDet model running on a 224mW chip achieves the speed of 106FPS with excellent accuracy.      
### 143.Slimmable Compressive Autoencoders for Practical Neural Image Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15726.pdf)
>  Neural image compression leverages deep neural networks to outperform traditional image codecs in rate-distortion performance. However, the resulting models are also heavy, computationally demanding and generally optimized for a single rate, limiting their practical use. Focusing on practical image compression, we propose slimmable compressive autoencoders (SlimCAEs), where rate (R) and distortion (D) are jointly optimized for different capacities. Once trained, encoders and decoders can be executed at different capacities, leading to different rates and complexities. We show that a successful implementation of SlimCAEs requires suitable capacity-specific RD tradeoffs. Our experiments show that SlimCAEs are highly flexible models that provide excellent rate-distortion performance, variable rate, and dynamic adjustment of memory, computational cost and latency, thus addressing the main requirements of practical image compression.      
### 144.von Mises--Fisher Loss: An Exploration of Embedding Geometries for Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15718.pdf)
>  Recent work has argued that classification losses utilizing softmax cross-entropy are superior not only for fixed-set classification tasks, but also by outperforming losses developed specifically for open-set tasks including few-shot learning and retrieval. Softmax classifiers have been studied using different embedding geometries -- Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical -- and claims have been made about the superiority of one or another, but they have not been systematically compared with careful controls. We conduct an empirical investigation of embedding geometry on softmax losses for a variety of fixed-set classification and image retrieval tasks. An interesting property observed for the spherical losses lead us to propose a probabilistic classifier based on the von Mises--Fisher distribution, and we show that it is competitive with state-of-the-art methods while producing improved out-of-the-box calibration. We provide guidance regarding the trade-offs between losses and how to choose among them.      
### 145.Omniscient Video Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15683.pdf)
>  Most recent video super-resolution (SR) methods either adopt an iterative manner to deal with low-resolution (LR) frames from a temporally sliding window, or leverage the previously estimated SR output to help reconstruct the current frame recurrently. A few studies try to combine these two structures to form a hybrid framework but have failed to give full play to it. In this paper, we propose an omniscient framework to not only utilize the preceding SR output, but also leverage the SR outputs from the present and future. The omniscient framework is more generic because the iterative, recurrent and hybrid frameworks can be regarded as its special cases. The proposed omniscient framework enables a generator to behave better than its counterparts under other frameworks. Abundant experiments on public datasets show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in objective metrics, subjective visual effects and complexity. Our code will be made public.      
### 146.Regular Polytope Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15632.pdf)
>  Neural networks are widely used as a model for classification in a large variety of tasks. Typically, a learnable transformation (i.e. the classifier) is placed at the end of such models returning a value for each class used for classification. This transformation plays an important role in determining how the generated features change during the learning process. In this work, we argue that this transformation not only can be fixed (i.e. set as non-trainable) with no loss of accuracy and with a reduction in memory usage, but it can also be used to learn stationary and maximally separated embeddings. We show that the stationarity of the embedding and its maximal separated representation can be theoretically justified by setting the weights of the fixed classifier to values taken from the coordinate vertices of the three regular polytopes available in $\mathbb{R}^d$, namely: the $d$-Simplex, the $d$-Cube and the $d$-Orthoplex. These regular polytopes have the maximal amount of symmetry that can be exploited to generate stationary features angularly centered around their corresponding fixed weights. Our approach improves and broadens the concept of a fixed classifier, recently proposed in \cite{hoffer2018fix}, to a larger class of fixed classifier models. Experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis, the generalization capability, the faster convergence and the improved performance of the proposed method. Code will be publicly available.      
### 147.SetVAE: Learning Hierarchical Composition for Generative Modeling of Set-Structured Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15619.pdf)
>  Generative modeling of set-structured data, such as point clouds, requires reasoning over local and global structures at various scales. However, adopting multi-scale frameworks for ordinary sequential data to a set-structured data is nontrivial as it should be invariant to the permutation of its elements. In this paper, we propose SetVAE, a hierarchical variational autoencoder for sets. Motivated by recent progress in set encoding, we build SetVAE upon attentive modules that first partition the set and project the partition back to the original cardinality. Exploiting this module, our hierarchical VAE learns latent variables at multiple scales, capturing coarse-to-fine dependency of the set elements while achieving permutation invariance. We evaluate our model on point cloud generation task and achieve competitive performance to the prior arts with substantially smaller model capacity. We qualitatively demonstrate that our model generalizes to unseen set sizes and learns interesting subset relations without supervision. Our implementation is available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/jw9730/setvae" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 148.RAN-GNNs: breaking the capacity limits of graph neural networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15565.pdf)
>  Graph neural networks have become a staple in problems addressing learning and analysis of data defined over graphs. However, several results suggest an inherent difficulty in extracting better performance by increasing the number of layers. Recent works attribute this to a phenomenon peculiar to the extraction of node features in graph-based tasks, i.e., the need to consider multiple neighborhood sizes at the same time and adaptively tune them. In this paper, we investigate the recently proposed randomly wired architectures in the context of graph neural networks. Instead of building deeper networks by stacking many layers, we prove that employing a randomly-wired architecture can be a more effective way to increase the capacity of the network and obtain richer representations. We show that such architectures behave like an ensemble of paths, which are able to merge contributions from receptive fields of varied size. Moreover, these receptive fields can also be modulated to be wider or narrower through the trainable weights over the paths. We also provide extensive experimental evidence of the superior performance of randomly wired architectures over multiple tasks and four graph convolution definitions, using recent benchmarking frameworks that addresses the reliability of previous testing methodologies.      
### 149.Data-driven generation of plausible tissue geometries for realistic photoacoustic image synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15510.pdf)
>  Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has the potential to recover morphological and functional tissue properties such as blood oxygenation with high spatial resolution and in an interventional setting. However, decades of research invested in solving the inverse problem of recovering clinically relevant tissue properties from spectral measurements have failed to produce solutions that can quantify tissue parameters robustly in a clinical setting. Previous attempts to address the limitations of model-based approaches with machine learning were hampered by the absence of labeled reference data needed for supervised algorithm training. While this bottleneck has been tackled by simulating training data, the domain gap between real and simulated images remains a huge unsolved challenge. As a first step to address this bottleneck, we propose a novel approach to PAT data simulation, which we refer to as "learning to simulate". Our approach involves subdividing the challenge of generating plausible simulations into two disjoint problems: (1) Probabilistic generation of realistic tissue morphology, represented by semantic segmentation maps and (2) pixel-wise assignment of corresponding optical and acoustic properties. In the present work, we focus on the first challenge. Specifically, we leverage the concept of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on semantically annotated medical imaging data to generate plausible tissue geometries. According to an initial in silico feasibility study our approach is well-suited for contributing to realistic PAT image synthesis and could thus become a fundamental step for deep learning-based quantitative PAT.      
### 150.ClaRe: Practical Class Incremental Learning By Remembering Previous Class Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15486.pdf)
>  This paper presents a practical and simple yet efficient method to effectively deal with the catastrophic forgetting for Class Incremental Learning (CIL) tasks. CIL tends to learn new concepts perfectly, but not at the expense of performance and accuracy for old data. Learning new knowledge in the absence of data instances from previous classes or even imbalance samples of both old and new classes makes CIL an ongoing challenging problem. These issues can be tackled by storing exemplars belonging to the previous tasks or by utilizing the rehearsal strategy. Inspired by the rehearsal strategy with the approach of using generative models, we propose ClaRe, an efficient solution for CIL by remembering the representations of learned classes in each increment. Taking this approach leads to generating instances with the same distribution of the learned classes. Hence, our model is somehow retrained from the scratch using a new training set including both new and the generated samples. Subsequently, the imbalance data problem is also solved. ClaRe has a better generalization than prior methods thanks to producing diverse instances from the distribution of previously learned classes. We comprehensively evaluate ClaRe on the MNIST benchmark. Results show a very low degradation on accuracy against facing new knowledge over time. Furthermore, contrary to the most proposed solutions, the memory limitation is not problematic any longer which is considered as a consequential issue in this research area.      
### 151.ZeroGrad : Mitigating and Explaining Catastrophic Overfitting in FGSM Adversarial Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15476.pdf)
>  Making deep neural networks robust to small adversarial noises has recently been sought in many applications. Adversarial training through iterative projected gradient descent (PGD) has been established as one of the mainstream ideas to achieve this goal. However, PGD is computationally demanding and often prohibitive in case of large datasets and models. For this reason, single-step PGD, also known as FGSM, has recently gained interest in the field. Unfortunately, FGSM-training leads to a phenomenon called ``catastrophic overfitting," which is a sudden drop in the adversarial accuracy under the PGD attack. In this paper, we support the idea that small input gradients play a key role in this phenomenon, and hence propose to zero the input gradient elements that are small for crafting FGSM attacks. Our proposed idea, while being simple and efficient, achieves competitive adversarial accuracy on various datasets.      
### 152.Lagrangian Objective Function Leads to Improved Unforeseen Attack Generalization in Adversarial Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15385.pdf)
>  Recent improvements in deep learning models and their practical applications have raised concerns about the robustness of these models against adversarial examples. Adversarial training (AT) has been shown effective to reach a robust model against the attack that is used during training. However, it usually fails against other attacks, i.e. the model overfits to the training attack scheme. In this paper, we propose a simple modification to the AT that mitigates the mentioned issue. More specifically, we minimize the perturbation $\ell_p$ norm while maximizing the classification loss in the Lagrangian form. We argue that crafting adversarial examples based on this scheme results in enhanced attack generalization in the learned model. We compare our final model robust accuracy against attacks that were not used during training to closely related state-of-the-art AT methods. This comparison demonstrates that our average robust accuracy against unseen attacks is 5.9% higher in the CIFAR-10 dataset and is 3.2% higher in the ImageNet-100 dataset than corresponding state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that our attack is faster than other attack schemes that are designed for unseen attack generalization, and conclude that it is feasible for large-scale datasets.      
### 153.Refractive Light-Field Features for Curved Transparent Objects in Structure from Motion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15349.pdf)
>  Curved refractive objects are common in the human environment, and have a complex visual appearance that can cause robotic vision algorithms to fail. Light-field cameras allow us to address this challenge by capturing the view-dependent appearance of such objects in a single exposure. We propose a novel image feature for light fields that detects and describes the patterns of light refracted through curved transparent objects. We derive characteristic points based on these features allowing them to be used in place of conventional 2D features. Using our features, we demonstrate improved structure-from-motion performance in challenging scenes containing refractive objects, including quantitative evaluations that show improved camera pose estimates and 3D reconstructions. Additionally, our methods converge 15-35% more frequently than the state-of-the-art. Our method is a critical step towards allowing robots to operate around refractive objects, with applications in manufacturing, quality assurance, pick-and-place, and domestic robots working with acrylic, glass and other transparent materials.      
### 154.FixNorm: Dissecting Weight Decay for Training Deep Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15345.pdf)
>  Weight decay is a widely used technique for training Deep Neural Networks(DNN). It greatly affects generalization performance but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Recent works show that for layers followed by normalizations, weight decay mainly affects the effective learning rate. However, despite normalizations have been extensively adopted in modern DNNs, layers such as the final fully-connected layer do not satisfy this precondition. For these layers, the effects of weight decay are still unclear. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the mechanisms of weight decay and find that except for influencing effective learning rate, weight decay has another distinct mechanism that is equally important: affecting generalization performance by controlling cross-boundary risk. These two mechanisms together give a more comprehensive explanation for the effects of weight decay. Based on this discovery, we propose a new training method called FixNorm, which discards weight decay and directly controls the two mechanisms. We also propose a simple yet effective method to tune hyperparameters of FixNorm, which can find near-optimal solutions in a few trials. On ImageNet classification task, training EfficientNet-B0 with FixNorm achieves 77.7%, which outperforms the original baseline by a clear margin. Surprisingly, when scaling MobileNetV2 to the same FLOPS and applying the same tricks with EfficientNet-B0, training with FixNorm achieves 77.4%, which is only 0.3% lower. A series of SOTA results show the importance of well-tuned training procedures, and further verify the effectiveness of our approach. We set up more well-tuned baselines using FixNorm, to facilitate fair comparisons in the community.      
### 155.Checkerboard Context Model for Efficient Learned Image Compression  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15306.pdf)
>  For learned image compression, the autoregressive context model is proved effective in improving the rate-distortion (RD) performance. Because it helps remove spatial redundancies among latent representations. However, the decoding process must be done in a strict scan order, which breaks the parallelization. We propose a parallelizable checkerboard context model (CCM) to solve the problem. Our two-pass checkerboard context calculation eliminates such limitations on spatial locations by re-organizing the decoding order. Speeding up the decoding process more than 40 times in our experiments, it achieves significantly improved computational efficiency with almost the same rate-distortion performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first exploration on parallelization-friendly spatial context model for learned image compression.      
### 156.Best-Buddy GANs for Highly Detailed Image Super-Resolution  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15295.pdf)
>  We consider the single image super-resolution (SISR) problem, where a high-resolution (HR) image is generated based on a low-resolution (LR) input. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) become popular to hallucinate details. Most methods along this line rely on a predefined single-LR-single-HR mapping, which is not flexible enough for the SISR task. Also, GAN-generated fake details may often undermine the realism of the whole image. We address these issues by proposing best-buddy GANs (Beby-GAN) for rich-detail SISR. Relaxing the immutable one-to-one constraint, we allow the estimated patches to dynamically seek the best supervision during training, which is beneficial to producing more reasonable details. Besides, we propose a region-aware adversarial learning strategy that directs our model to focus on generating details for textured areas adaptively. Extensive experiments justify the effectiveness of our method. An ultra-high-resolution 4K dataset is also constructed to facilitate future super-resolution research.      
### 157.Explaining Representation by Mutual Information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15114.pdf)
>  Science is used to discover the law of world. Machine learning can be used to discover the law of data. In recent years, there are more and more research about interpretability in machine learning community. We hope the machine learning methods are safe, interpretable, and they can help us to find meaningful pattern in data. In this paper, we focus on interpretability of deep representation. We propose a interpretable method of representation based on mutual information, which summarizes the interpretation of representation into three types of information between input data and representation. We further proposed MI-LR module, which can be inserted into the model to estimate the amount of information to explain the model's representation. Finally, we verify the method through the visualization of the prototype network.      
### 158.Improved Autoregressive Modeling with Distribution Smoothing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15089.pdf)
>  While autoregressive models excel at image compression, their sample quality is often lacking. Although not realistic, generated images often have high likelihood according to the model, resembling the case of adversarial examples. Inspired by a successful adversarial defense method, we incorporate randomized smoothing into autoregressive generative modeling. We first model a smoothed version of the data distribution, and then reverse the smoothing process to recover the original data distribution. This procedure drastically improves the sample quality of existing autoregressive models on several synthetic and real-world image datasets while obtaining competitive likelihoods on synthetic datasets.      
### 159.Self-supervised Discriminative Feature Learning for Multi-view Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15069.pdf)
>  Multi-view clustering is an important research topic due to its capability to utilize complementary information from multiple views. However, there are few methods to consider the negative impact caused by certain views with unclear clustering structures, resulting in poor multi-view clustering performance. To address this drawback, we propose self-supervised discriminative feature learning for multi-view clustering (SDMVC). Concretely, deep autoencoders are applied to learn embedded features for each view independently. To leverage the multi-view complementary information, we concatenate all views' embedded features to form the global features, which can overcome the negative impact of some views' unclear clustering structures. In a self-supervised manner, pseudo-labels are obtained to build a unified target distribution to perform multi-view discriminative feature learning. During this process, global discriminative information can be mined to supervise all views to learn more discriminative features, which in turn are used to update the target distribution. Besides, this unified target distribution can make SDMVC learn consistent cluster assignments, which accomplishes the clustering consistency of multiple views while preserving their features' diversity. Experiments on various types of multi-view datasets show that SDMVC achieves state-of-the-art performance.      
### 160.Invertible Image Signal Processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15061.pdf)
>  Unprocessed RAW data is a highly valuable image format for image editing and computer vision. However, since the file size of RAW data is huge, most users can only get access to processed and compressed sRGB images. To bridge this gap, we design an Invertible Image Signal Processing (InvISP) pipeline, which not only enables rendering visually appealing sRGB images but also allows recovering nearly perfect RAW data. Due to our framework's inherent reversibility, we can reconstruct realistic RAW data instead of synthesizing RAW data from sRGB images without any memory overhead. We also integrate a differentiable JPEG compression simulator that empowers our framework to reconstruct RAW data from JPEG images. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two DSLR demonstrate that our method obtains much higher quality in both rendered sRGB images and reconstructed RAW data than alternative methods.      
### 161.Adaptive Autonomy in Human-on-the-Loop Vision-Based Robotics Systems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15053.pdf)
>  Computer vision approaches are widely used by autonomous robotic systems to sense the world around them and to guide their decision making as they perform diverse tasks such as collision avoidance, search and rescue, and object manipulation. High accuracy is critical, particularly for Human-on-the-loop (HoTL) systems where decisions are made autonomously by the system, and humans play only a supervisory role. Failures of the vision model can lead to erroneous decisions with potentially life or death consequences. In this paper, we propose a solution based upon adaptive autonomy levels, whereby the system detects loss of reliability of these models and responds by temporarily lowering its own autonomy levels and increasing engagement of the human in the decision-making process. Our solution is applicable for vision-based tasks in which humans have time to react and provide guidance. When implemented, our approach would estimate the reliability of the vision task by considering uncertainty in its model, and by performing covariate analysis to determine when the current operating environment is ill-matched to the model's training data. We provide examples from DroneResponse, in which small Unmanned Aerial Systems are deployed for Emergency Response missions, and show how the vision model's reliability would be used in addition to confidence scores to drive and specify the behavior and adaptation of the system's autonomy. This workshop paper outlines our proposed approach and describes open challenges at the intersection of Computer Vision and Software Engineering for the safe and reliable deployment of vision models in the decision making of autonomous systems.      
### 162.Catalyzing Clinical Diagnostic Pipelines Through Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation Using Deep Neural Networks: Past, Present, &amp; Future  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14969.pdf)
>  Deep learning has made a remarkable impact in the field of natural image processing over the past decade. Consequently, there is a great deal of interest in replicating this success across unsolved tasks in related domains, such as medical image analysis. Core to medical image analysis is the task of semantic segmentation which enables various clinical workflows. Due to the challenges inherent in manual segmentation, many decades of research have been devoted to discovering extensible, automated, expert-level segmentation techniques. Given the groundbreaking performance demonstrated by recent neural network-based techniques, deep learning seems poised to achieve what classic methods have historically been unable. <br>This paper will briefly overview some of the state-of-the-art (SoTA) neural network-based segmentation algorithms with a particular emphasis on the most recent architectures, comparing and contrasting the contributions and characteristics of each network topology. Using ultrasonography as a motivating example, it will also demonstrate important clinical implications of effective deep learning-based solutions, articulate challenges unique to the modality, and discuss novel approaches developed in response to those challenges, concluding with the proposal of future directions in the field. <br>Given the generally observed ephemerality of the best deep learning approaches (i.e. the extremely quick succession of the SoTA), the main contributions of the paper are its contextualization of modern deep learning architectures with historical background and the elucidation of the current trajectory of volumetric medical image segmentation research.      
### 163.Particle Filter Bridge Interpolation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14963.pdf)
>  Auto encoding models have been extensively studied in recent years. They provide an efficient framework for sample generation, as well as for analysing feature learning. Furthermore, they are efficient in performing interpolations between data-points in semantically meaningful ways. In this paper, we build further on a previously introduced method for generating canonical, dimension independent, stochastic interpolations. Here, the distribution of interpolation paths is represented as the distribution of a bridge process constructed from an artificial random data generating process in the latent space, having the prior distribution as its invariant distribution. As a result the stochastic interpolation paths tend to reside in regions of the latent space where the prior has high mass. This is a desirable feature since, generally, such areas produce semantically meaningful samples. In this paper, we extend the bridge process method by introducing a discriminator network that accurately identifies areas of high latent representation density. The discriminator network is incorporated as a change of measure of the underlying bridge process and sampling of interpolation paths is implemented using sequential Monte Carlo. The resulting sampling procedure allows for greater variability in interpolation paths and stronger drift towards areas of high data density.      
### 164.Improving prostate whole gland segmentation in t2-weighted MRI with synthetically generated data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14955.pdf)
>  Whole gland (WG) segmentation of the prostate plays a crucial role in detection, staging and treatment planning of prostate cancer (PCa). Despite promise shown by deep learning (DL) methods, they rely on the availability of a considerable amount of annotated data. Augmentation techniques such as translation and rotation of images present an alternative to increase data availability. Nevertheless, the amount of information provided by the transformed data is limited due to the correlation between the generated data and the original. Based on the recent success of generative adversarial networks (GAN) in producing synthetic images for other domains as well as in the medical domain, we present a pipeline to generate WG segmentation masks and synthesize T2-weighted MRI of the prostate based on a publicly available multi-center dataset. Following, we use the generated data as a form of data augmentation. Results show an improvement in the quality of the WG segmentation when compared to standard augmentation techniques.      
### 165.Frequency-specific segregation and integration of human cerebral cortex: an intrinsic functional atlas  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14907.pdf)
>  The frequency-specific coupling mechanism of the functional human brain networks underpins its complex cognitive and behavioral functions. Nevertheless, it is not well unveiled what are the frequency-specific subdivisions and network topologies of the human brain. In this study, we estimated functional connectivity of the human cerebral cortex using spectral connection, and conducted frequency-specific parcellation using eigen-clustering and gradient-based methods, and then explored their topological structures. 7T fMRI data of 184 subjects in the HCP dataset were used for parcellation and exploring the topological properties of the functional networks, and 3T fMRI data of another 890 subjects were used to confirm the stability of the frequency-specific topologies. Seven to ten functional networks were stably integrated by two to four dissociable hub categories at specific frequencies, and we proposed an intrinsic functional atlas containing 456 parcels according to the parcellations across frequencies. The results revealed that the functional networks contained stable frequency-specific topologies, which may imply more abundant roles of the functional units and more complex interactions among them.      
### 166.Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) with Generator Regularization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14884.pdf)
>  Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks are known to be difficult to train, especially when the conditions are continuous and high-dimensional. To partially alleviate this difficulty, we propose a simple generator regularization term on the GAN generator loss in the form of Lipschitz penalty. Thus, when the generator is fed with neighboring conditions in the continuous space, the regularization term will leverage the neighbor information and push the generator to generate samples that have similar conditional distributions for each neighboring condition. We analyze the effect of the proposed regularization term and demonstrate its robust performance on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks.      
### 167.LiBRe: A Practical Bayesian Approach to Adversarial Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14835.pdf)
>  Despite their appealing flexibility, deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable against adversarial examples. Various adversarial defense strategies have been proposed to resolve this problem, but they typically demonstrate restricted practicability owing to unsurmountable compromise on universality, effectiveness, or efficiency. In this work, we propose a more practical approach, Lightweight Bayesian Refinement (LiBRe), in the spirit of leveraging Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) for adversarial detection. Empowered by the task and attack agnostic modeling under Bayes principle, LiBRe can endow a variety of pre-trained task-dependent DNNs with the ability of defending heterogeneous adversarial attacks at a low cost. We develop and integrate advanced learning techniques to make LiBRe appropriate for adversarial detection. Concretely, we build the few-layer deep ensemble variational and adopt the pre-training &amp; fine-tuning workflow to boost the effectiveness and efficiency of LiBRe. We further provide a novel insight to realise adversarial detection-oriented uncertainty quantification without inefficiently crafting adversarial examples during training. Extensive empirical studies covering a wide range of scenarios verify the practicability of LiBRe. We also conduct thorough ablation studies to evidence the superiority of our modeling and learning strategies.      
### 168.Ensemble-in-One: Learning Ensemble within Random Gated Networks for Enhanced Adversarial Robustness  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14795.pdf)
>  Adversarial attacks have rendered high security risks on modern deep learning systems. Adversarial training can significantly enhance the robustness of neural network models by suppressing the non-robust features. However, the models often suffer from significant accuracy loss on clean data. Ensemble training methods have emerged as promising solutions for defending against adversarial attacks by diversifying the vulnerabilities among the sub-models, simultaneously maintaining comparable accuracy as standard training. However, existing ensemble methods are with poor scalability, owing to the rapid complexity increase when including more sub-models in the ensemble. Moreover, in real-world applications, it is difficult to deploy an ensemble with multiple sub-models, owing to the tight hardware resource budget and latency requirement. In this work, we propose ensemble-in-one (EIO), a simple but efficient way to train an ensemble within one random gated network (RGN). EIO augments the original model by replacing the parameterized layers with multi-path random gated blocks (RGBs) to construct a RGN. By diversifying the vulnerability of the numerous paths within the RGN, better robustness can be achieved. It provides high scalability because the paths within an EIO network exponentially increase with the network depth. Our experiments demonstrate that EIO consistently outperforms previous ensemble training methods with even less computational overhead.      
### 169.Fully Automated 2D and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks Pipeline for Video Segmentation and Myocardial Infarction Detection in Echocardiography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14734.pdf)
>  Cardiac imaging known as echocardiography is a non-invasive tool utilized to produce data including images and videos, which cardiologists use to diagnose cardiac abnormalities in general and myocardial infarction (MI) in particular. Echocardiography machines can deliver abundant amounts of data that need to be quickly analyzed by cardiologists to help them make a diagnosis and treat cardiac conditions. However, the acquired data quality varies depending on the acquisition conditions and the patient's responsiveness to the setup instructions. These constraints are challenging to doctors especially when patients are facing MI and their lives are at stake. In this paper, we propose an innovative real-time end-to-end fully automated model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect MI depending on regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) of the left ventricle (LV) from videos produced by echocardiography. Our model is implemented as a pipeline consisting of a 2D CNN that performs data preprocessing by segmenting the LV chamber from the apical four-chamber (A4C) view, followed by a 3D CNN that performs a binary classification to detect if the segmented echocardiography shows signs of MI. We trained both CNNs on a dataset composed of 165 echocardiography videos each acquired from a distinct patient. The 2D CNN achieved an accuracy of 97.18% on data segmentation while the 3D CNN achieved 90.9% of accuracy, 100% of precision and 95% of recall on MI detection. Our results demonstrate that creating a fully automated system for MI detection is feasible and propitious.      
### 170.Tuning IR-cut Filter for Illumination-aware Spectral Reconstruction from RGB  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14708.pdf)
>  To reconstruct spectral signals from multi-channel observations, in particular trichromatic RGBs, has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional scanning-based spectral imager. It has been proven that the reconstruction accuracy relies heavily on the spectral response of the RGB camera in use. To improve accuracy, data-driven algorithms have been proposed to retrieve the best response curves of existing RGB cameras, or even to design brand new three-channel response curves. Instead, this paper explores the filter-array based color imaging mechanism of existing RGB cameras, and proposes to design the IR-cut filter properly for improved spectral recovery, which stands out as an in-between solution with better trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and implementation complexity. We further propose a deep learning based spectral reconstruction method, which allows to recover the illumination spectrum as well. Experiment results with both synthetic and real images under daylight illumination have shown the benefits of our IR-cut filter tuning method and our illumination-aware spectral reconstruction method.      
### 171.Quantum Self-Supervised Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14653.pdf)
>  The popularisation of neural networks has seen incredible advances in pattern recognition, driven by the supervised learning of human annotations. However, this approach is unsustainable in relation to the dramatically increasing size of real-world datasets. This has led to a resurgence in self-supervised learning, a paradigm whereby the model generates its own supervisory signal from the data. Here we propose a hybrid quantum-classical neural network architecture for contrastive self-supervised learning and test its effectiveness in proof-of-principle experiments. Interestingly, we observe a numerical advantage for the learning of visual representations using small-scale quantum neural networks over equivalently structured classical networks, even when the quantum circuits are sampled with only 100 shots. Furthermore, we apply our best quantum model to classify unseen images on the ibmq_paris quantum computer and find that current noisy devices can already achieve equal accuracy to the equivalent classical model on downstream tasks.      
### 172.Overprotective Training Environments Fall Short at Testing Time: Let Models Contribute to Their Own Training  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11145.pdf)
>  Despite important progress, conversational systems often generate dialogues that sound unnatural to humans. We conjecture that the reason lies in their different training and testing conditions: agents are trained in a controlled "lab" setting but tested in the "wild". During training, they learn to generate an utterance given the human dialogue history. On the other hand, during testing, they must interact with each other, and hence deal with noisy data. We propose to fill this gap by training the model with mixed batches containing both samples of human and machine-generated dialogues. We assess the validity of the proposed method on
