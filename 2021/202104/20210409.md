### 1.Learning optical flow from still images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03965.pdf)
>  This paper deals with the scarcity of data for training optical flow networks, highlighting the limitations of existing sources such as labeled synthetic datasets or unlabeled real videos. Specifically, we introduce a framework to generate accurate ground-truth optical flow annotations quickly and in large amounts from any readily available single real picture. Given an image, we use an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimation network to build a plausible point cloud for the observed scene. Then, we virtually move the camera in the reconstructed environment with known motion vectors and rotation angles, allowing us to synthesize both a novel view and the corresponding optical flow field connecting each pixel in the input image to the one in the new frame. When trained with our data, state-of-the-art optical flow networks achieve superior generalization to unseen real data compared to the same models trained either on annotated synthetic datasets or unlabeled videos, and better specialization if combined with synthetic images.      
### 2.Handwriting Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03964.pdf)
>  We propose a novel transformer-based styled handwritten text image generation approach, HWT, that strives to learn both style-content entanglement as well as global and local writing style patterns. The proposed HWT captures the long and short range relationships within the style examples through a self-attention mechanism, thereby encoding both global and local style patterns. Further, the proposed transformer-based HWT comprises an encoder-decoder attention that enables style-content entanglement by gathering the style representation of each query character. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a transformer-based generative network for styled handwritten text generation. Our proposed HWT generates realistic styled handwritten text images and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art demonstrated through extensive qualitative, quantitative and human-based evaluations. The proposed HWT can handle arbitrary length of text and any desired writing style in a few-shot setting. Further, our HWT generalizes well to the challenging scenario where both words and writing style are unseen during training, generating realistic styled handwritten text images.      
### 3.InfinityGAN: Towards Infinite-Resolution Image Synthesis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03963.pdf)
>  We present InfinityGAN, a method to generate arbitrary-resolution images. The problem is associated with several key challenges. First, scaling existing models to a high resolution is resource-constrained, both in terms of computation and availability of high-resolution training data. Infinity-GAN trains and infers patch-by-patch seamlessly with low computational resources. Second, large images should be locally and globally consistent, avoid repetitive patterns, and look realistic. To address these, InfinityGAN takes global appearance, local structure and texture into account.With this formulation, we can generate images with resolution and level of detail not attainable before. Experimental evaluation supports that InfinityGAN generates imageswith superior global structure compared to baselines at the same time featuring parallelizable inference. Finally, we how several applications unlocked by our approach, such as fusing styles spatially, multi-modal outpainting and image inbetweening at arbitrary input and output resolutions      
### 4.Panoptic Segmentation Forecasting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03962.pdf)
>  Our goal is to forecast the near future given a set of recent observations. We think this ability to forecast, i.e., to anticipate, is integral for the success of autonomous agents which need not only passively analyze an observation but also must react to it in real-time. Importantly, accurate forecasting hinges upon the chosen scene decomposition. We think that superior forecasting can be achieved by decomposing a dynamic scene into individual 'things' and background 'stuff'. Background 'stuff' largely moves because of camera motion, while foreground 'things' move because of both camera and individual object motion. Following this decomposition, we introduce panoptic segmentation forecasting. Panoptic segmentation forecasting opens up a middle-ground between existing extremes, which either forecast instance trajectories or predict the appearance of future image frames. To address this task we develop a two-component model: one component learns the dynamics of the background stuff by anticipating odometry, the other one anticipates the dynamics of detected things. We establish a leaderboard for this novel task, and validate a state-of-the-art model that outperforms available baselines.      
### 5.Modulated Periodic Activations for Generalizable Local Functional Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03960.pdf)
>  Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) make powerful functional representations for sampling and reconstruction problems involving low-dimensional signals like images,shapes and light fields. Recent works have significantly improved their ability to represent high-frequency content by using periodic activations or positional encodings. This often came at the expense of generalization: modern methods are typically optimized for a single signal. We present a new representation that generalizes to multiple instances and achieves state-of-the-art fidelity. We use a dual-MLP architecture to encode the signals. A synthesis network creates a functional mapping from a low-dimensional input (e.g. pixel-position) to the output domain (e.g. RGB color). A modulation network maps a latent code corresponding to the target signal to parameters that modulate the periodic activations of the synthesis network. We also propose a local-functional representation which enables generalization. The signal's domain is partitioned into a regular grid,with each tile represented by a latent code. At test time, the signal is encoded with high-fidelity by inferring (or directly optimizing) the latent code-book. Our approach produces generalizable functional representations of images, videos and shapes, and achieves higher reconstruction quality than prior works that are optimized for a single signal.      
### 6.Just Label What You Need: Fine-Grained Active Selection for Perception and Prediction through Partially Labeled Scenes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03956.pdf)
>  Self-driving vehicles must perceive and predict the future positions of nearby actors in order to avoid collisions and drive safely. A learned deep learning module is often responsible for this task, requiring large-scale, high-quality training datasets. As data collection is often significantly cheaper than labeling in this domain, the decision of which subset of examples to label can have a profound impact on model performance. Active learning techniques, which leverage the state of the current model to iteratively select examples for labeling, offer a promising solution to this problem. However, despite the appeal of this approach, there has been little scientific analysis of active learning approaches for the perception and prediction (P&amp;P) problem. In this work, we study active learning techniques for P&amp;P and find that the traditional active learning formulation is ill-suited for the P&amp;P setting. We thus introduce generalizations that ensure that our approach is both cost-aware and allows for fine-grained selection of examples through partially labeled scenes. Our experiments on a real-world, large-scale self-driving dataset suggest that fine-grained selection can improve the performance across perception, prediction, and downstream planning tasks.      
### 7.De-rendering the World's Revolutionary Artefacts  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03954.pdf)
>  Recent works have shown exciting results in unsupervised image de-rendering -- learning to decompose 3D shape, appearance, and lighting from single-image collections without explicit supervision. However, many of these assume simplistic material and lighting models. We propose a method, termed RADAR, that can recover environment illumination and surface materials from real single-image collections, relying neither on explicit 3D supervision, nor on multi-view or multi-light images. Specifically, we focus on rotationally symmetric artefacts that exhibit challenging surface properties including specular reflections, such as vases. We introduce a novel self-supervised albedo discriminator, which allows the model to recover plausible albedo without requiring any ground-truth during training. In conjunction with a shape reconstruction module exploiting rotational symmetry, we present an end-to-end learning framework that is able to de-render the world's revolutionary artefacts. We conduct experiments on a real vase dataset and demonstrate compelling decomposition results, allowing for applications including free-viewpoint rendering and relighting.      
### 8.SNARF: Differentiable Forward Skinning for Animating Non-Rigid Neural Implicit Shapes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03953.pdf)
>  Neural implicit surface representations have emerged as a promising paradigm to capture 3D shapes in a continuous and resolution-independent manner. However, adapting them to articulated shapes is non-trivial. Existing approaches learn a backward warp field that maps deformed to canonical points. However, this is problematic since the backward warp field is pose dependent and thus requires large amounts of data to learn. To address this, we introduce SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined in canonical, pose-independent space, allowing for generalization to unseen poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not be unique under changes of topology. We propose a forward skinning model that finds all canonical correspondences of any deformed point using iterative root finding. We derive analytical gradients via implicit differentiation, enabling end-to-end training from 3D meshes with bone transformations. Compared to state-of-the-art neural implicit representations, our approach generalizes better to unseen poses while preserving accuracy. We demonstrate our method in challenging scenarios on (clothed) 3D humans in diverse and unseen poses.      
### 9.The Single-Noun Prior for Image Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03952.pdf)
>  Self-supervised clustering methods have achieved increasing accuracy in recent years but do not yet perform as well as supervised classification methods. This contrasts with the situation for feature learning, where self-supervised features have recently surpassed the performance of supervised features on several important tasks. We hypothesize that the performance gap is due to the difficulty of specifying, without supervision, which features correspond to class differences that are semantic to humans. To reduce the performance gap, we introduce the "single-noun" prior - which states that semantic clusters tend to correspond to concepts that humans label by a single-noun. By utilizing a pre-trained network that maps images and sentences into a common space, we impose this prior obtaining a constrained optimization task. We show that our formulation is a special case of the facility location problem, and introduce a simple-yet-effective approach for solving this optimization task at scale. We test our approach on several commonly reported image clustering datasets and obtain significant accuracy gains over the best existing approaches.      
### 10.Conditional Meta-Network for Blind Super-Resolution with Multiple Degradations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03926.pdf)
>  Although single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods have achieved great success on single degradation, they still suffer performance drop with multiple degrading effects in real scenarios. Recently, some blind and non-blind models for multiple degradations have been explored. However, those methods usually degrade significantly for distribution shifts between the training and test data. Towards this end, we propose a conditional meta-network framework (named CMDSR) for the first time, which helps SR framework learn how to adapt to changes in input distribution. We extract degradation prior at task-level with the proposed ConditionNet, which will be used to adapt the parameters of the basic SR network (BaseNet). Specifically, the ConditionNet of our framework first learns the degradation prior from a support set, which is composed of a series of degraded image patches from the same task. Then the adaptive BaseNet rapidly shifts its parameters according to the conditional features. Moreover, in order to better extract degradation prior, we propose a task contrastive loss to decrease the inner-task distance and increase the cross-task distance between task-level features. Without predefining degradation maps, our blind framework can conduct one single parameter update to yield considerable SR results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CMDSR over various blind, even non-blind methods. The flexible BaseNet structure also reveals that CMDSR can be a general framework for large series of SISR models.      
### 11.Field Convolutions for Surface CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03916.pdf)
>  We present a novel surface convolution operator acting on vector fields that is based on a simple observation: instead of combining neighboring features with respect to a single coordinate parameterization defined at a given point, we have every neighbor describe the position of the point within its own coordinate frame. This formulation combines intrinsic spatial convolution with parallel transport in a scattering operation while placing no constraints on the filters themselves, providing a definition of convolution that commutes with the action of isometries, has increased descriptive potential, and is robust to noise and other nuisance factors. The result is a rich notion of convolution which we call field convolution, well-suited for CNNs on surfaces. Field convolutions are flexible and straight-forward to implement, and their highly discriminating nature has cascading effects throughout the learning pipeline. Using simple networks constructed from residual field convolution blocks, we achieve state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks in fundamental geometry processing tasks, such as shape classification, segmentation, correspondence, and sparse matching.      
### 12.Enhancing Object Detection for Autonomous Driving by Optimizing Anchor Generation and Addressing Class Imbalance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03888.pdf)
>  Object detection has been one of the most active topics in computer vision for the past years. Recent works have mainly focused on pushing the state-of-the-art in the general-purpose COCO benchmark. However, the use of such detection frameworks in specific applications such as autonomous driving is yet an area to be addressed. This study presents an enhanced 2D object detector based on Faster R-CNN that is better suited for the context of autonomous vehicles. Two main aspects are improved: the anchor generation procedure and the performance drop in minority classes. The default uniform anchor configuration is not suitable in this scenario due to the perspective projection of the vehicle cameras. Therefore, we propose a perspective-aware methodology that divides the image into key regions via clustering and uses evolutionary algorithms to optimize the base anchors for each of them. Furthermore, we add a module that enhances the precision of the second-stage header network by including the spatial information of the candidate regions proposed in the first stage. We also explore different re-weighting strategies to address the foreground-foreground class imbalance, showing that the use of a reduced version of focal loss can significantly improve the detection of difficult and underrepresented objects in two-stage detectors. Finally, we design an ensemble model to combine the strengths of the different learning strategies. Our proposal is evaluated with the Waymo Open Dataset, which is the most extensive and diverse up to date. The results demonstrate an average accuracy improvement of 6.13% mAP when using the best single model, and of 9.69% mAP with the ensemble. The proposed modifications over the Faster R-CNN do not increase computational cost and can easily be extended to optimize other anchor-based detection frameworks.      
### 13.SMD-Nets: Stereo Mixture Density Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03866.pdf)
>  Despite stereo matching accuracy has greatly improved by deep learning in the last few years, recovering sharp boundaries and high-resolution outputs efficiently remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Stereo Mixture Density Networks (SMD-Nets), a simple yet effective learning framework compatible with a wide class of 2D and 3D architectures which ameliorates both issues. Specifically, we exploit bimodal mixture densities as output representation and show that this allows for sharp and precise disparity estimates near discontinuities while explicitly modeling the aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the observations. Moreover, we formulate disparity estimation as a continuous problem in the image domain, allowing our model to query disparities at arbitrary spatial precision. We carry out comprehensive experiments on a new high-resolution and highly realistic synthetic stereo dataset, consisting of stereo pairs at 8Mpx resolution, as well as on real-world stereo datasets. Our experiments demonstrate increased depth accuracy near object boundaries and prediction of ultra high-resolution disparity maps on standard GPUs. We demonstrate the flexibility of our technique by improving the performance of a variety of stereo backbones.      
### 14.Modeling Object Dissimilarity for Deep Saliency Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03864.pdf)
>  Saliency prediction has made great strides over the past two decades, with current techniques modeling low-level information, such as color, intensity and size contrasts, and high-level one, such as attention and gaze direction for entire objects. Despite this, these methods fail to account for the dissimilarity between objects, which humans naturally do. In this paper, we introduce a detection-guided saliency prediction network that explicitly models the differences between multiple objects, such as their appearance and size dissimilarities. Our approach is general, allowing us to fuse our object dissimilarities with features extracted by any deep saliency prediction network. As evidenced by our experiments, this consistently boosts the accuracy of the baseline networks, enabling us to outperform the state-of-the-art models on three saliency benchmarks, namely SALICON, MIT300 and CAT2000.      
### 15.3D Surfel Map-Aided Visual Relocalization with Learned Descriptors  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03856.pdf)
>  In this paper, we introduce a method for visual relocalization using the geometric information from a 3D surfel map. A visual database is first built by global indices from the 3D surfel map rendering, which provides associations between image points and 3D surfels. Surfel reprojection constraints are utilized to optimize the keyframe poses and map points in the visual database. A hierarchical camera relocalization algorithm then utilizes the visual database to estimate 6-DoF camera poses. Learned descriptors are further used to improve the performance in challenging cases. We present evaluation under real-world conditions and simulation to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method, and make the final camera poses consistently well aligned with the 3D environment.      
### 16.Towards End-to-End Neural Face Authentication in the Wild - Quantifying and Compensating for Directional Lighting Effects  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03854.pdf)
>  The recent availability of low-power neural accelerator hardware, combined with improvements in end-to-end neural facial recognition algorithms provides, enabling technology for on-device facial authentication. The present research work examines the effects of directional lighting on a State-of-Art(SoA) neural face recognizer. A synthetic re-lighting technique is used to augment data samples due to the lack of public data-sets with sufficient directional lighting variations. Top lighting and its variants (top-left, top-right) are found to have minimal effect on accuracy, while bottom-left or bottom-right directional lighting has the most pronounced effects. Following the fine-tuning of network weights, the face recognition model is shown to achieve close to the original Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC)performance across all lighting conditions and demonstrates an ability to generalize beyond the lighting augmentations used in the fine-tuning data-set. This work shows that an SoA neural face recognition model can be tuned to compensate for directional lighting effects, removing the need for a pre-processing step before applying facial recognition.      
### 17.CoCoNets: Continuous Contrastive 3D Scene Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03851.pdf)
>  This paper explores self-supervised learning of amodal 3D feature representations from RGB and RGB-D posed images and videos, agnostic to object and scene semantic content, and evaluates the resulting scene representations in the downstream tasks of visual correspondence, object tracking, and object detection. The model infers a latent3D representation of the scene in the form of 3D feature points, where each continuous world 3D point is mapped to its corresponding feature vector. The model is trained for contrastive view prediction by rendering 3D feature clouds in queried viewpoints and matching against the 3D feature point cloud predicted from the query view. Notably, the representation can be queried for any 3D location, even if it is not visible from the input view. Our model brings together three powerful ideas of recent exciting research work: 3D feature grids as a neural bottleneck for view prediction, implicit functions for handling resolution limitations of 3D grids, and contrastive learning for unsupervised training of feature representations. We show the resulting 3D visual feature representations effectively scale across objects and scenes, imagine information occluded or missing from the input viewpoints, track objects over time, align semantically related objects in 3D, and improve 3D object detection. We outperform many existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D feature learning and view prediction, which are either limited by 3D grid spatial resolution, do not attempt to build amodal 3D representations, or do not handle combinatorial scene variability due to their non-convolutional bottlenecks.      
### 18.InAugment: Improving Classifiers via Internal Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03843.pdf)
>  Image augmentation techniques apply transformation functions such as rotation, shearing, or color distortion on an input image. These augmentations were proven useful in improving neural networks' generalization ability. In this paper, we present a novel augmentation operation, InAugment, that exploits image internal statistics. The key idea is to copy patches from the image itself, apply augmentation operations on them, and paste them back at random positions on the same image. This method is simple and easy to implement and can be incorporated with existing augmentation techniques. We test InAugment on two popular datasets -- CIFAR and ImageNet. We show improvement over state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. Incorporating InAugment with Auto Augment yields a significant improvement over other augmentation techniques (e.g., +1% improvement over multiple architectures trained on the CIFAR dataset). We also demonstrate an increase for ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B3 top-1's accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to prior augmentation methods. Finally, our experiments suggest that training convolutional neural network using InAugment not only improves the model's accuracy and confidence but its performance on out-of-distribution images.      
### 19.ORBIT: A Real-World Few-Shot Dataset for Teachable Object Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03841.pdf)
>  Object recognition has made great advances in the last decade, but predominately still relies on many high-quality training examples per object category. In contrast, learning new objects from only a few examples could enable many impactful applications from robotics to user personalization. Most few-shot learning research, however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that lack the high variation that these applications will face when deployed in the real-world. To close this gap, we present the ORBIT dataset and benchmark, grounded in a real-world application of teachable object recognizers for people who are blind/low vision. The dataset contains 3,822 videos of 486 objects recorded by people who are blind/low-vision on their mobile phones, and the benchmark reflects a realistic, highly challenging recognition problem, providing a rich playground to drive research in robustness to few-shot, high-variation conditions. We set the first state-of-the-art on the benchmark and show that there is massive scope for further innovation, holding the potential to impact a broad range of real-world vision applications including tools for the blind/low-vision community. The dataset and benchmark code can be accessed at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/microsoft/ORBIT-Dataset" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 20.Does Your Dermatology Classifier Know What It Doesn't Know? Detecting the Long-Tail of Unseen Conditions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03829.pdf)
>  We develop and rigorously evaluate a deep learning based system that can accurately classify skin conditions while detecting rare conditions for which there is not enough data available for training a confident classifier. We frame this task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. Our novel approach, hierarchical outlier detection (HOD) assigns multiple abstention classes for each training outlier class and jointly performs a coarse classification of inliers vs. outliers, along with fine-grained classification of the individual classes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the HOD loss in conjunction with modern representation learning approaches (BiT, SimCLR, MICLe) and explore different ensembling strategies for further improving the results. We perform an extensive subgroup analysis over conditions of varying risk levels and different skin types to investigate how the OOD detection performance changes over each subgroup and demonstrate the gains of our framework in comparison to baselines. Finally, we introduce a cost metric to approximate downstream clinical impact. We use this cost metric to compare the proposed method against a baseline system, thereby making a stronger case for the overall system effectiveness in a real-world deployment scenario.      
### 21.Robust Differentiable SVD  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03821.pdf)
>  Eigendecomposition of symmetric matrices is at the heart of many computer vision algorithms. However, the derivatives of the eigenvectors tend to be numerically unstable, whether using the SVD to compute them analytically or using the Power Iteration (PI) method to approximate them. This instability arises in the presence of eigenvalues that are close to each other. This makes integrating eigendecomposition into deep networks difficult and often results in poor convergence, particularly when dealing with large matrices. <br>While this can be mitigated by partitioning the data into small arbitrary groups, doing so has no theoretical basis and makes it impossible to exploit the full power of eigendecomposition. In previous work, we mitigated this using SVD during the forward pass and PI to compute the gradients during the backward pass. However, the iterative deflation procedure required to compute multiple eigenvectors using PI tends to accumulate errors and yield inaccurate gradients. Here, we show that the Taylor expansion of the SVD gradient is theoretically equivalent to the gradient obtained using PI without relying in practice on an iterative process and thus yields more accurate gradients. We demonstrate the benefits of this increased accuracy for image classification and style transfer.      
### 22.A Bayesian Approach to Reinforcement Learning of Vision-Based Vehicular Control  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03807.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning method for autonomous driving. Our approach employs temporal difference learning in a Bayesian framework to learn vehicle control signals from sensor data. The agent has access to images from a forward facing camera, which are preprocessed to generate semantic segmentation maps. We trained our system using both ground truth and estimated semantic segmentation input. Based on our observations from a large set of experiments, we conclude that training the system on ground truth input data leads to better performance than training the system on estimated input even if estimated input is used for evaluation. The system is trained and evaluated in a realistic simulated urban environment using the CARLA simulator. The simulator also contains a benchmark that allows for comparing to other systems and methods. The required training time of the system is shown to be lower and the performance on the benchmark superior to competing approaches.      
### 23.Progressive Semantic Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03778.pdf)
>  The objective of this work is to segment high-resolution images without overloading GPU memory usage or losing the fine details in the output segmentation map. The memory constraint means that we must either downsample the big image or divide the image into local patches for separate processing. However, the former approach would lose the fine details, while the latter can be ambiguous due to the lack of a global picture. In this work, we present MagNet, a multi-scale framework that resolves local ambiguity by looking at the image at multiple magnification levels. MagNet has multiple processing stages, where each stage corresponds to a magnification level, and the output of one stage is fed into the next stage for coarse-to-fine information propagation. Each stage analyzes the image at a higher resolution than the previous stage, recovering the previously lost details due to the lossy downsampling step, and the segmentation output is progressively refined through the processing stages. Experiments on three high-resolution datasets of urban views, aerial scenes, and medical images show that MagNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.      
### 24.Affine-modeled video extraction from a single motion blurred image  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03777.pdf)
>  A motion-blurred image is the temporal average of multiple sharp frames over the exposure time. Recovering these sharp video frames from a single blurred image is nontrivial, due to not only its strong ill-posedness, but also various types of complex motion in reality such as rotation and motion in depth. In this work, we report a generalized video extraction method using the affine motion modeling, enabling to tackle multiple types of complex motion and their mixing. In its workflow, the moving objects are first segemented in the alpha channel. This allows separate recovery of different objects with different motion. Then, we reduce the variable space by modeling each video clip as a series of affine transformations of a reference frame, and introduce the $l0$-norm total variation regularization to attenuate the ringing artifact. The differentiable affine operators are employed to realize gradient-descent optimization of the affine model, which follows a novel coarse-to-fine strategy to further reduce artifacts. As a result, both the affine parameters and sharp reference image are retrieved. They are finally input into stepwise affine transformation to recover the sharp video frames. The stepwise retrieval maintains the nature to bypass the frame order ambiguity. Experiments on both public datasets and real captured data validate the state-of-the-art performance of the reported technique.      
### 25.Geometry-based Distance Decomposition for Monocular 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03775.pdf)
>  Monocular 3D object detection is of great significance for autonomous driving but remains challenging. The core challenge is to predict the distance of objects in the absence of explicit depth information. Unlike regressing the distance as a single variable in most existing methods, we propose a novel geometry-based distance decomposition to recover the distance by its factors. The decomposition factors the distance of objects into the most representative and stable variables, i.e. the physical height and the projected visual height in the image plane. Moreover, the decomposition maintains the self-consistency between the two heights, leading to the robust distance prediction when both predicted heights are inaccurate. The decomposition also enables us to trace the cause of the distance uncertainty for different scenarios. Such decomposition makes the distance prediction interpretable, accurate, and robust. Our method directly predicts 3D bounding boxes from RGB images with a compact architecture, making the training and inference simple and efficient. The experimental results show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the monocular 3D Object detection and Birds Eye View tasks on the KITTI dataset, and can generalize to images with different camera intrinsics.      
### 26.Robust Self-Ensembling Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03765.pdf)
>  Recent research has shown the great potential of deep learning algorithms in the hyperspectral image (HSI) classification task. Nevertheless, training these models usually requires a large amount of labeled data. Since the collection of pixel-level annotations for HSI is laborious and time-consuming, developing algorithms that can yield good performance in the small sample size situation is of great significance. In this study, we propose a robust self-ensembling network (RSEN) to address this problem. The proposed RSEN consists of two subnetworks including a base network and an ensemble network. With the constraint of both the supervised loss from the labeled data and the unsupervised loss from the unlabeled data, the base network and the ensemble network can learn from each other, achieving the self-ensembling mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first attempt to introduce the self-ensembling technique into the HSI classification task, which provides a different view on how to utilize the unlabeled data in HSI to assist the network training. We further propose a novel consistency filter to increase the robustness of self-ensembling learning. Extensive experiments on three benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can yield competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 27.Video Question Answering with Phrases via Semantic Roles  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03762.pdf)
>  Video Question Answering (VidQA) evaluation metrics have been limited to a single-word answer or selecting a phrase from a fixed set of phrases. These metrics limit the VidQA models' application scenario. In this work, we leverage semantic roles derived from video descriptions to mask out certain phrases, to introduce VidQAP which poses VidQA as a fill-in-the-phrase task. To enable evaluation of answer phrases, we compute the relative improvement of the predicted answer compared to an empty string. To reduce the influence of language bias in VidQA datasets, we retrieve a video having a different answer for the same question. To facilitate research, we construct ActivityNet-SRL-QA and Charades-SRL-QA and benchmark them by extending three vision-language models. We further perform extensive analysis and ablative studies to guide future work.      
### 28.Few-Shot Action Recognition with Compromised Metric via Optimal Transport  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03737.pdf)
>  Although vital to computer vision systems, few-shot action recognition is still not mature despite the wide research of few-shot image classification. Popular few-shot learning algorithms extract a transferable embedding from seen classes and reuse it on unseen classes by constructing a metric-based classifier. One main obstacle to applying these algorithms in action recognition is the complex structure of videos. Some existing solutions sample frames from a video and aggregate their embeddings to form a video-level representation, neglecting important temporal relations. Others perform an explicit sequence matching between two videos and define their distance as matching cost, imposing too strong restrictions on sequence ordering. In this paper, we propose Compromised Metric via Optimal Transport (CMOT) to combine the advantages of these two solutions. CMOT simultaneously considers semantic and temporal information in videos under Optimal Transport framework, and is discriminative for both content-sensitive and ordering-sensitive tasks. In detail, given two videos, we sample segments from them and cast the calculation of their distance as an optimal transport problem between two segment sequences. To preserve the inherent temporal ordering information, we additionally amend the ground cost matrix by penalizing it with the positional distance between a pair of segments. Empirical results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of CMOT.      
### 29.HindSight: A Graph-Based Vision Model Architecture For Representing Part-Whole Hierarchies  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03722.pdf)
>  This paper presents a model architecture for encoding the representations of part-whole hierarchies in images in form of a graph. The idea is to divide the image into patches of different levels and then treat all of these patches as nodes for a fully connected graph. A dynamic feature extraction module is used to extract feature representations from these patches in each graph iteration. This enables us to learn a rich graph representation of the image that encompasses the inherent part-whole hierarchical information. Utilizing proper self-supervised training techniques, such a model can be trained as a general purpose vision encoder model which can then be used for various vision related downstream tasks (e.g., Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Captioning, etc.).      
### 30.Learning specialized activation functions with the Piecewise Linear Unit  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03693.pdf)
>  The choice of activation functions is crucial for modern deep neural networks. Popular hand-designed activation functions like Rectified Linear Unit(ReLU) and its variants show promising performance in various tasks and models. Swish, the automatically discovered activation function, has been proposed and outperforms ReLU on many challenging datasets. However, it has two main drawbacks. First, the tree-based search space is highly discrete and restricted, which is difficult for searching. Second, the sample-based searching method is inefficient, making it infeasible to find specialized activation functions for each dataset or neural architecture. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a new activation function called Piecewise Linear Unit(PWLU), which incorporates a carefully designed formulation and learning method. It can learn specialized activation functions and achieves SOTA performance on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and COCO. For example, on ImageNet classification dataset, PWLU improves 0.9%/0.53%/1.0%/1.7%/1.0% top-1 accuracy over Swish for ResNet-18/ResNet-50/MobileNet-V2/MobileNet-V3/EfficientNet-B0. PWLU is also easy to implement and efficient at inference, which can be widely applied in real-world applications.      
### 31.3D Shape Generation and Completion through Point-Voxel Diffusion  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03670.pdf)
>  We propose a novel approach for probabilistic generative modeling of 3D shapes. Unlike most existing models that learn to deterministically translate a latent vector to a shape, our model, Point-Voxel Diffusion (PVD), is a unified, probabilistic formulation for unconditional shape generation and conditional, multi-modal shape completion. PVD marries denoising diffusion models with the hybrid, point-voxel representation of 3D shapes. It can be viewed as a series of denoising steps, reversing the diffusion process from observed point cloud data to Gaussian noise, and is trained by optimizing a variational lower bound to the (conditional) likelihood function. Experiments demonstrate that PVD is capable of synthesizing high-fidelity shapes, completing partial point clouds, and generating multiple completion results from single-view depth scans of real objects.      
### 32.DSC-PoseNet: Learning 6DoF Object Pose Estimation via Dual-scale Consistency  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03658.pdf)
>  Compared to 2D object bounding-box labeling, it is very difficult for humans to annotate 3D object poses, especially when depth images of scenes are unavailable. This paper investigates whether we can estimate the object poses effectively when only RGB images and 2D object annotations are given. To this end, we present a two-step pose estimation framework to attain 6DoF object poses from 2D object bounding-boxes. In the first step, the framework learns to segment objects from real and synthetic data in a weakly-supervised fashion, and the segmentation masks will act as a prior for pose estimation. In the second step, we design a dual-scale pose estimation network, namely DSC-PoseNet, to predict object poses by employing a differential renderer. To be specific, our DSC-PoseNet firstly predicts object poses in the original image scale by comparing the segmentation masks and the rendered visible object masks. Then, we resize object regions to a fixed scale to estimate poses once again. In this fashion, we eliminate large scale variations and focus on rotation estimation, thus facilitating pose estimation. Moreover, we exploit the initial pose estimation to generate pseudo ground-truth to train our DSC-PoseNet in a self-supervised manner. The estimation results in these two scales are ensembled as our final pose estimation. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on synthetic data by a large margin and even is on par with several fully-supervised methods.      
### 33.How Transferable are Reasoning Patterns in VQA?  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03656.pdf)
>  Since its inception, Visual Question Answering (VQA) is notoriously known as a task, where models are prone to exploit biases in datasets to find shortcuts instead of performing high-level reasoning. Classical methods address this by removing biases from training data, or adding branches to models to detect and remove biases. In this paper, we argue that uncertainty in vision is a dominating factor preventing the successful learning of reasoning in vision and language problems. We train a visual oracle and in a large scale study provide experimental evidence that it is much less prone to exploiting spurious dataset biases compared to standard models. We propose to study the attention mechanisms at work in the visual oracle and compare them with a SOTA Transformer-based model. We provide an in-depth analysis and visualizations of reasoning patterns obtained with an online visualization tool which we make publicly available (<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://reasoningpatterns.github.io" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>). We exploit these insights by transferring reasoning patterns from the oracle to a SOTA Transformer-based VQA model taking standard noisy visual inputs via fine-tuning. In experiments we report higher overall accuracy, as well as accuracy on infrequent answers for each question type, which provides evidence for improved generalization and a decrease of the dependency on dataset biases.      
### 34.Semantic Scene Completion via Integrating Instances and Scene in-the-Loop  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03640.pdf)
>  Semantic Scene Completion aims at reconstructing a complete 3D scene with precise voxel-wise semantics from a single-view depth or RGBD image. It is a crucial but challenging problem for indoor scene understanding. In this work, we present a novel framework named Scene-Instance-Scene Network (\textit{SISNet}), which takes advantages of both instance and scene level semantic information. Our method is capable of inferring fine-grained shape details as well as nearby objects whose semantic categories are easily mixed-up. The key insight is that we decouple the instances from a coarsely completed semantic scene instead of a raw input image to guide the reconstruction of instances and the overall scene. SISNet conducts iterative scene-to-instance (SI) and instance-to-scene (IS) semantic completion. Specifically, the SI is able to encode objects' surrounding context for effectively decoupling instances from the scene and each instance could be voxelized into higher resolution to capture finer details. With IS, fine-grained instance information can be integrated back into the 3D scene and thus leads to more accurate semantic scene completion. Utilizing such an iterative mechanism, the scene and instance completion benefits each other to achieve higher completion accuracy. Extensively experiments show that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both real NYU, NYUCAD and synthetic SUNCG-RGBD datasets. The code and the supplementary material will be available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/yjcaimeow/SISNet" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 35.Open Domain Generalization with Domain-Augmented Meta-Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03620.pdf)
>  Leveraging datasets available to learn a model with high generalization ability to unseen domains is important for computer vision, especially when the unseen domain's annotated data are unavailable. We study a novel and practical problem of Open Domain Generalization (OpenDG), which learns from different source domains to achieve high performance on an unknown target domain, where the distributions and label sets of each individual source domain and the target domain can be different. The problem can be generally applied to diverse source domains and widely applicable to real-world applications. We propose a Domain-Augmented Meta-Learning framework to learn open-domain generalizable representations. We augment domains on both feature-level by a new Dirichlet mixup and label-level by distilled soft-labeling, which complements each domain with missing classes and other domain knowledge. We conduct meta-learning over domains by designing new meta-learning tasks and losses to preserve domain unique knowledge and generalize knowledge across domains simultaneously. Experiment results on various multi-domain datasets demonstrate that the proposed Domain-Augmented Meta-Learning (DAML) outperforms prior methods for unseen domain recognition.      
### 36.SiT: Self-supervised vIsion Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03602.pdf)
>  Self-supervised learning methods are gaining increasing traction in computer vision due to their recent success in reducing the gap with supervised learning. In natural language processing (NLP) self-supervised learning and transformers are already the methods of choice. The recent literature suggests that the transformers are becoming increasingly popular also in computer vision. So far, the vision transformers have been shown to work well when pretrained either using a large scale supervised data or with some kind of co-supervision, e.g. in terms of teacher network. These supervised pretrained vision transformers achieve very good results in downstream tasks with minimal changes. In this work we investigate the merits of self-supervised learning for pretraining image/vision transformers and then using them for downstream classification tasks. We propose Self-supervised vIsion Transformers (SiT) and discuss several self-supervised training mechanisms to obtain a pretext model. The architectural flexibility of SiT allows us to use it as an autoencoder and work with multiple self-supervised tasks seamlessly. We show that a pretrained SiT can be finetuned for a downstream classification task on small scale datasets, consisting of a few thousand images rather than several millions. The proposed approach is evaluated on standard datasets using common protocols. The results demonstrate the strength of the transformers and their suitability for self-supervised learning. We outperformed existing self-supervised learning methods by large margin. We also observed that SiT is good for few shot learning and also showed that it is learning useful representation by simply training a linear classifier on top of the learned features from SiT. Pretraining, finetuning, and evaluation codes will be available under: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/Sara-Ahmed/SiT" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 37.PQA: Perceptual Question Answering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03589.pdf)
>  Perceptual organization remains one of the very few established theories on the human visual system. It underpinned many pre-deep seminal works on segmentation and detection, yet research has seen a rapid decline since the preferential shift to learning deep models. Of the limited attempts, most aimed at interpreting complex visual scenes using perceptual organizational rules. This has however been proven to be sub-optimal, since models were unable to effectively capture the visual complexity in real-world imagery. In this paper, we rejuvenate the study of perceptual organization, by advocating two positional changes: (i) we examine purposefully generated synthetic data, instead of complex real imagery, and (ii) we ask machines to synthesize novel perceptually-valid patterns, instead of explaining existing data. Our overall answer lies with the introduction of a novel visual challenge -- the challenge of perceptual question answering (PQA). Upon observing example perceptual question-answer pairs, the goal for PQA is to solve similar questions by generating answers entirely from scratch (see Figure 1). Our first contribution is therefore the first dataset of perceptual question-answer pairs, each generated specifically for a particular Gestalt principle. We then borrow insights from human psychology to design an agent that casts perceptual organization as a self-attention problem, where a proposed grid-to-grid mapping network directly generates answer patterns from scratch. Experiments show our agent to outperform a selection of naive and strong baselines. A human study however indicates that ours uses astronomically more data to learn when compared to an average human, necessitating future research (with or without our dataset).      
### 38.PDO-e$\text{S}^\text{2}$CNNs: Partial Differential Operator Based Equivariant Spherical CNNs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03584.pdf)
>  Spherical signals exist in many applications, e.g., planetary data, LiDAR scans and digitalization of 3D objects, calling for models that can process spherical data effectively. It does not perform well when simply projecting spherical data into the 2D plane and then using planar convolution neural networks (CNNs), because of the distortion from projection and ineffective translation equivariance. Actually, good principles of designing spherical CNNs are avoiding distortions and converting the shift equivariance property in planar CNNs to rotation equivariance in the spherical domain. In this work, we use partial differential operators (PDOs) to design a spherical equivariant CNN, PDO-e$\text{S}^\text{2}$CNN, which is exactly rotation equivariant in the continuous domain. We then discretize PDO-e$\text{S}^\text{2}$CNNs, and analyze the equivariance error resulted from discretization. This is the first time that the equivariance error is theoretically analyzed in the spherical domain. In experiments, PDO-e$\text{S}^\text{2}$CNNs show greater parameter efficiency and outperform other spherical CNNs significantly on several tasks.      
### 39.ASFlow: Unsupervised Optical Flow Learning with Adaptive Pyramid Sampling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03560.pdf)
>  We present an unsupervised optical flow estimation method by proposing an adaptive pyramid sampling in the deep pyramid network. Specifically, in the pyramid downsampling, we propose an Content Aware Pooling (CAP) module, which promotes local feature gathering by avoiding cross region pooling, so that the learned features become more representative. In the pyramid upsampling, we propose an Adaptive Flow Upsampling (AFU) module, where cross edge interpolation can be avoided, producing sharp motion boundaries. Equipped with these two modules, our method achieves the best performance for unsupervised optical flow estimation on multiple leading benchmarks, including MPI-SIntel, KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015. Particuarlly, we achieve EPE=1.5 on KITTI 2012 and F1=9.67% KITTI 2015, which outperform the previous state-of-the-art methods by 16.7% and 13.1%, respectively.      
### 40.1st Place Solution to ICDAR 2021 RRC-ICTEXT End-to-end Text Spotting and Aesthetic Assessment on Integrated Circuit  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03544.pdf)
>  This paper presents our proposed methods to ICDAR 2021 Robust Reading Challenge - Integrated Circuit Text Spotting and Aesthetic Assessment (ICDAR RRC-ICTEXT 2021). For the text spotting task, we detect the characters on integrated circuit and classify them based on yolov5 detection model. We balance the lowercase and non-lowercase by using SynthText, generated data and data sampler. We adopt semi-supervised algorithm and distillation to furtherly improve the model's accuracy. For the aesthetic assessment task, we add a classification branch of 3 classes to differentiate the aesthetic classes of each character. Finally, we make model deployment to accelerate inference speed and reduce memory consumption based on NVIDIA Tensorrt. Our methods achieve 59.1 mAP on task 3.1 with 31 FPS and 306M memory (rank 1), 78.7\% F2 score on task 3.2 with 30 FPS and 306M memory (rank 1).      
### 41.Multiple Object Tracking with Correlation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03541.pdf)
>  Recent works have shown that convolutional networks have substantially improved the performance of multiple object tracking by simultaneously learning detection and appearance features. However, due to the local perception of the convolutional network structure itself, the long-range dependencies in both the spatial and temporal cannot be obtained efficiently. To incorporate the spatial layout, we propose to exploit the local correlation module to model the topological relationship between targets and their surrounding environment, which can enhance the discriminative power of our model in crowded scenes. Specifically, we establish dense correspondences of each spatial location and its context, and explicitly constrain the correlation volumes through self-supervised learning. To exploit the temporal context, existing approaches generally utilize two or more adjacent frames to construct an enhanced feature representation, but the dynamic motion scene is inherently difficult to depict via CNNs. Instead, our paper proposes a learnable correlation operator to establish frame-to-frame matches over convolutional feature maps in the different layers to align and propagate temporal context. With extensive experimental results on the MOT datasets, our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of correlation learning with the superior performance and obtains state-of-the-art MOTA of 76.5% and IDF1 of 73.6% on MOT17.      
### 42.An Empirical Study of the Effects of Sample-Mixing Methods for Efficient Training of Generative Adversarial Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03535.pdf)
>  It is well-known that training of generative adversarial networks (GANs) requires huge iterations before the generator's providing good-quality samples. Although there are several studies to tackle this problem, there is still no universal solution. In this paper, we investigated the effect of sample mixing methods, that is, Mixup, CutMix, and newly proposed Smoothed Regional Mix (SRMix), to alleviate this problem. The sample-mixing methods are known to enhance the accuracy and robustness in the wide range of classification problems, and can naturally be applicable to GANs because the role of the discriminator can be interpreted as the classification between real and fake samples. We also proposed a new formalism applying the sample-mixing methods to GANs with the saturated losses which do not have a clear "label" of real and fake. We performed a vast amount of numerical experiments using LSUN and CelebA datasets. The results showed that Mixup and SRMix improved the quality of the generated images in terms of FID in most cases, in particular, SRMix showed the best improvement in most cases. Our analysis indicates that the mixed-samples can provide different properties from the vanilla fake samples, and the mixing pattern strongly affects the decision of the discriminators. The generated images of Mixup have good high-level feature but low-level feature is not so impressible. On the other hand, CutMix showed the opposite tendency. Our SRMix showed the middle tendency, that is, showed good high and low level features. We believe that our finding provides a new perspective to accelerate the GANs convergence and improve the quality of generated samples.      
### 43.Pseudo-supervised Deep Subspace Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03531.pdf)
>  Auto-Encoder (AE)-based deep subspace clustering (DSC) methods have achieved impressive performance due to the powerful representation extracted using deep neural networks while prioritizing categorical separability. However, self-reconstruction loss of an AE ignores rich useful relation information and might lead to indiscriminative representation, which inevitably degrades the clustering performance. It is also challenging to learn high-level similarity without feeding semantic labels. Another unsolved problem facing DSC is the huge memory cost due to $n\times n$ similarity matrix, which is incurred by the self-expression layer between an encoder and decoder. To tackle these problems, we use pairwise similarity to weigh the reconstruction loss to capture local structure information, while a similarity is learned by the self-expression layer. Pseudo-graphs and pseudo-labels, which allow benefiting from uncertain knowledge acquired during network training, are further employed to supervise similarity learning. Joint learning and iterative training facilitate to obtain an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. By combining with the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm, we further show that our method can address the large-scale and out-of-sample problems.      
### 44.Deep Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation via Cascaded Dimension-Lifting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03520.pdf)
>  The 3D pose estimation from a single image is a challenging problem due to depth ambiguity. One type of the previous methods lifts 2D joints, obtained by resorting to external 2D pose detectors, to the 3D space. However, this type of approaches discards the contextual information of images which are strong cues for 3D pose estimation. Meanwhile, some other methods predict the joints directly from monocular images but adopt a 2.5D output representation $P^{2.5D} = (u,v,z^{r}) $ where both $u$ and $v$ are in the image space but $z^{r}$ in root-relative 3D space. Thus, the ground-truth information (e.g., the depth of root joint from the camera) is normally utilized to transform the 2.5D output to the 3D space, which limits the applicability in practice. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end framework that not only exploits the contextual information but also produces the output directly in the 3D space via cascaded dimension-lifting. Specifically, we decompose the task of lifting pose from 2D image space to 3D spatial space into several sequential sub-tasks, 1) kinematic skeletons \&amp; individual joints estimation in 2D space, 2) root-relative depth estimation, and 3) lifting to the 3D space, each of which employs direct supervisions and contextual image features to guide the learning process. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used 3D human pose datasets (Human3.6M, MuPoTS-3D).      
### 45.TokenPose: Learning Keypoint Tokens for Human Pose Estimation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03516.pdf)
>  Human pose estimation deeply relies on visual clues and anatomical constraints between parts to locate keypoints. Most existing CNN-based methods do well in visual representation, however, lacking in the ability to explicitly learn the constraint relationships between keypoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Token representation for human Pose estimation~(TokenPose). In detail, each keypoint is explicitly embedded as a token to simultaneously learn constraint relationships and appearance cues from images. Extensive experiments show that the small and large TokenPose models are on par with state-of-the-art CNN-based counterparts while being more lightweight. Specifically, our TokenPose-S and TokenPose-L achieve 72.5 AP and 75.8 AP on COCO validation dataset respectively, with significant reduction in parameters (\textcolor{red}{ $\downarrow80.6\%$} ; \textcolor{red}{$\downarrow$ $56.8\%$}) and GFLOPs (\textcolor{red}{$\downarrow$$ 75.3\%$}; \textcolor{red}{$\downarrow$ $24.7\%$}).      
### 46.Reconstructing Recognizable 3D Face Shapes based on 3D Morphable Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03515.pdf)
>  Many recent works have reconstructed distinctive 3D face shapes by aggregating shape parameters of the same identity and separating those of different people based on parametric models (e.g., 3D morphable models (3DMMs)). However, despite the high accuracy in the face recognition task using these shape parameters, the visual discrimination of face shapes reconstructed from those parameters is unsatisfactory. The following research question has not been answered in previous works: Do discriminative shape parameters guarantee visual discrimination in represented 3D face shapes? This paper analyzes the relationship between shape parameters and reconstructed shape geometry and proposes a novel shape identity-aware regularization(SIR) loss for shape parameters, aiming at increasing discriminability in both the shape parameter and shape geometry domains. Moreover, to cope with the lack of training data containing both landmark and identity annotations, we propose a network structure and an associated training strategy to leverage mixed data containing either identity or landmark labels. We compare our method with existing methods in terms of the reconstruction error, visual distinguishability, and face recognition accuracy of the shape parameters. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.      
### 47.Siam-ReID: Confuser Aware Siamese Tracker with Re-identification Feature  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03510.pdf)
>  Siamese deep-network trackers have received significant attention in recent years due to their real-time speed and state-of-the-art performance. However, Siamese trackers suffer from similar looking confusers, that are prevalent in aerial imagery and create challenging conditions due to prolonged occlusions where the tracker object re-appears under different pose and illumination. Our work proposes SiamReID, a novel re-identification framework for Siamese trackers, that incorporates confuser rejection during prolonged occlusions and is well-suited for aerial tracking. The re-identification feature is trained using both triplet loss and a class balanced loss. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the UAVDT single object tracking benchmark.      
### 48.Py-Feat: Python Facial Expression Analysis Toolbox  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03509.pdf)
>  Studying facial expressions is a notoriously difficult endeavor. Recent advances in the field of affective computing have yielded impressive progress in automatically detecting facial expressions from pictures and videos. However, much of this work has yet to be widely disseminated in social science domains such as psychology. Current state of the art models require considerable domain expertise that is not traditionally incorporated into social science training programs. Furthermore, there is a notable absence of user-friendly and open-source software that provides a comprehensive set of tools and functions that support facial expression research. In this paper, we introduce Py-Feat, an open-source Python toolbox that provides support for detecting, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing facial expression data. Py-Feat makes it easy for domain experts to disseminate and benchmark computer vision models and also for end users to quickly process, analyze, and visualize face expression data. We hope this platform will facilitate increased use of facial expression data in human behavior research.      
### 49.Progressive Temporal Feature Alignment Network for Video Inpainting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03507.pdf)
>  Video inpainting aims to fill spatio-temporal "corrupted" regions with plausible content. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to find correspondences from neighbouring frames to faithfully hallucinate the unknown content. Current methods achieve this goal through attention, flow-based warping, or 3D temporal convolution. However, flow-based warping can create artifacts when optical flow is not accurate, while temporal convolution may suffer from spatial misalignment. We propose 'Progressive Temporal Feature Alignment Network', which progressively enriches features extracted from the current frame with the feature warped from neighbouring frames using optical flow. Our approach corrects the spatial misalignment in the temporal feature propagation stage, greatly improving visual quality and temporal consistency of the inpainted videos. Using the proposed architecture, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS and FVI datasets compared to existing deep learning approaches.

### 50.DeepI2P: Image-to-Point Cloud Registration via Deep Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03501.pdf)
>  This paper presents DeepI2P: a novel approach for cross-modality registration between an image and a point cloud. Given an image (e.g. from a rgb-camera) and a general point cloud (e.g. from a 3D Lidar scanner) captured at different locations in the same scene, our method estimates the relative rigid transformation between the coordinate frames of the camera and Lidar. Learning common feature descriptors to establish correspondences for the registration is inherently challenging due to the lack of appearance and geometric correlations across the two modalities. We circumvent the difficulty by converting the registration problem into a classification and inverse camera projection optimization problem. A classification neural network is designed to label whether the projection of each point in the point cloud is within or beyond the camera frustum. These labeled points are subsequently passed into a novel inverse camera projection solver to estimate the relative pose. Extensive experimental results on Oxford Robotcar and KITTI datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.

### 51.Prototypical Region Proposal Networks for Few-Shot Localization and Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03496.pdf)
>  Recently proposed few-shot image classification methods have generally focused on use cases where the objects to be classified are the central subject of images. Despite success on benchmark vision datasets aligned with this use case, these methods typically fail on use cases involving densely-annotated, busy images: images common in the wild where objects of relevance are not the central subject, instead appearing potentially occluded, small, or among other incidental objects belonging to other classes of potential interest. To localize relevant objects, we employ a prototype-based few-shot segmentation model which compares the encoded features of unlabeled query images with support class centroids to produce region proposals indicating the presence and location of support set classes in a query image. These region proposals are then used as additional conditioning input to few-shot image classifiers. We develop a framework to unify the two stages (segmentation and classification) into an end-to-end classification model -- PRoPnet -- and empirically demonstrate that our methods improve accuracy on image datasets with natural scenes containing multiple object classes.      
### 52.Riggable 3D Face Reconstruction via In-Network Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03493.pdf)
>  This paper presents a method for riggable 3D face reconstruction from monocular images, which jointly estimates a personalized face rig and per-image parameters including expressions, poses, and illuminations. To achieve this goal, we design an end-to-end trainable network embedded with a differentiable in-network optimization. The network first parameterizes the face rig as a compact latent code with a neural decoder, and then estimates the latent code as well as per-image parameters via a learnable optimization. By estimating a personalized face rig, our method goes beyond static reconstructions and enables downstream applications such as video retargeting. In-network optimization explicitly enforces constraints derived from the first principles, thus introduces additional priors than regression-based methods. Finally, data-driven priors from deep learning are utilized to constrain the ill-posed monocular setting and ease the optimization difficulty. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA reconstruction accuracy, reasonable robustness and generalization ability, and supports standard face rig applications.      
### 53.Deep Features for training Support Vector Machine  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03488.pdf)
>  Features play a crucial role in computer vision. Initially designed to detect salient elements by means of handcrafted algorithms, features are now often learned by different layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a generic computer vision system based on features extracted from trained CNNs. Multiple learned features are combined into a single structure to work on different image classification tasks. The proposed system was experimentally derived by testing several approaches for extracting features from the inner layers of CNNs and using them as inputs to SVMs that are then combined by sum rule. Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to reduce the high dimensionality of inner layers. The resulting vision system is shown to significantly boost the performance of standard CNNs across a large and diverse collection of image data sets. An ensemble of different topologies using the same approach obtains state-of-the-art results on a virus data set.      
### 54.Convolutional Neural Network Pruning with Structural Redundancy Reduction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03438.pdf)
>  Convolutional neural network (CNN) pruning has become one of the most successful network compression approaches in recent years. Existing works on network pruning usually focus on removing the least important filters in the network to achieve compact architectures. In this study, we claim that identifying structural redundancy plays a more essential role than finding unimportant filters, theoretically and empirically. We first statistically model the network pruning problem in a redundancy reduction perspective and find that pruning in the layer(s) with the most structural redundancy outperforms pruning the least important filters across all layers. Based on this finding, we then propose a network pruning approach that identifies structural redundancy of a CNN and prunes filters in the selected layer(s) with the most redundancy. Experiments on various benchmark network architectures and datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.      
### 55.CAPTRA: CAtegory-level Pose Tracking for Rigid and Articulated Objects from Point Clouds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03437.pdf)
>  In this work, we tackle the problem of category-level online pose tracking of objects from point cloud sequences. For the first time, we propose a unified framework that can handle 9DoF pose tracking for novel rigid object instances as well as per-part pose tracking for articulated objects from known categories. Here the 9DoF pose, comprising 6D pose and 3D size, is equivalent to a 3D amodal bounding box representation with free 6D pose. Given the depth point cloud at the current frame and the estimated pose from the last frame, our novel end-to-end pipeline learns to accurately update the pose. Our pipeline is composed of three modules: 1) a pose canonicalization module that normalizes the pose of the input depth point cloud; 2) RotationNet, a module that directly regresses small interframe delta rotations; and 3) CoordinateNet, a module that predicts the normalized coordinates and segmentation, enabling analytical computation of the 3D size and translation. Leveraging the small pose regime in the pose-canonicalized point clouds, our method integrates the best of both worlds by combining dense coordinate prediction and direct rotation regression, thus yielding an end-to-end differentiable pipeline optimized for 9DoF pose accuracy (without using non-differentiable RANSAC). Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on category-level rigid object pose (NOCS-REAL275) and articulated object pose benchmarks (SAPIEN , BMVC) at the fastest FPS ~12.      
### 56.Multimodal Fusion Refiner Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03435.pdf)
>  Tasks that rely on multi-modal information typically include a fusion module that combines information from different modalities. In this work, we develop a Refiner Fusion Network (ReFNet) that enables fusion modules to combine strong unimodal representation with strong multimodal representations. ReFNet combines the fusion network with a decoding/defusing module, which imposes a modality-centric responsibility condition. This approach addresses a big gap in existing multimodal fusion frameworks by ensuring that both unimodal and fused representations are strongly encoded in the latent fusion space. We demonstrate that the Refiner Fusion Network can improve upon performance of powerful baseline fusion modules such as multimodal transformers. The refiner network enables inducing graphical representations of the fused embeddings in the latent space, which we prove under certain conditions and is supported by strong empirical results in the numerical experiments. These graph structures are further strengthened by combining the ReFNet with a Multi-Similarity contrastive loss function. The modular nature of Refiner Fusion Network lends itself to be combined with different fusion architectures easily, and in addition, the refiner step can be applied for pre-training on unlabeled datasets, thus leveraging unsupervised data towards improving performance. We demonstrate the power of Refiner Fusion Networks on three datasets, and further show that they can maintain performance with only a small fraction of labeled data.      
### 57.FatNet: A Feature-attentive Network for 3D Point Cloud Processing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03427.pdf)
>  The application of deep learning to 3D point clouds is challenging due to its lack of order. Inspired by the point embeddings of PointNet and the edge embeddings of DGCNNs, we propose three improvements to the task of point cloud analysis. First, we introduce a novel feature-attentive neural network layer, a FAT layer, that combines both global point-based features and local edge-based features in order to generate better embeddings. Second, we find that applying the same attention mechanism across two different forms of feature map aggregation, max pooling and average pooling, gives better performance than either alone. Third, we observe that residual feature reuse in this setting propagates information more effectively between the layers, and makes the network easier to train. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the task of point cloud classification, as demonstrated on the ModelNet40 dataset, and an extremely competitive performance on the ShapeNet part segmentation challenge.      
### 58.Track, Check, Repeat: An EM Approach to Unsupervised Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03424.pdf)
>  We propose an unsupervised method for detecting and tracking moving objects in 3D, in unlabelled RGB-D videos. The method begins with classic handcrafted techniques for segmenting objects using motion cues: we estimate optical flow and camera motion, and conservatively segment regions that appear to be moving independently of the background. Treating these initial segments as pseudo-labels, we learn an ensemble of appearance-based 2D and 3D detectors, under heavy data augmentation. We use this ensemble to detect new instances of the "moving" type, even if they are not moving, and add these as new pseudo-labels. Our method is an expectation-maximization algorithm, where in the expectation step we fire all modules and look for agreement among them, and in the maximization step we re-train the modules to improve this agreement. The constraint of ensemble agreement helps combat contamination of the generated pseudo-labels (during the E step), and data augmentation helps the modules generalize to yet-unlabelled data (during the M step). We compare against existing unsupervised object discovery and tracking methods, using challenging videos from CATER and KITTI, and show strong improvements over the state-of-the-art.      
### 59.Towards On-Device Face Recognition in Body-worn Cameras  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03419.pdf)
>  Face recognition technology related to recognizing identities is widely adopted in intelligence gathering, law enforcement, surveillance, and consumer applications. Recently, this technology has been ported to smartphones and body-worn cameras (BWC). Face recognition technology in body-worn cameras is used for surveillance, situational awareness, and keeping the officer safe. Only a handful of academic studies exist in face recognition using the body-worn camera. A recent study has assembled BWCFace facial image dataset acquired using a body-worn camera and evaluated the ResNet-50 model for face identification. However, for real-time inference in resource constraint body-worn cameras and privacy concerns involving facial images, on-device face recognition is required. To this end, this study evaluates lightweight MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, LightCNN-9 and LightCNN-29 models for face identification using body-worn camera. Experiments are performed on a publicly available BWCface dataset. The real-time inference is evaluated on three mobile devices. The comparative analysis is done with heavy-weight VGG-16 and ResNet-50 models along with six hand-crafted features to evaluate the trade-off between the performance and model size. Experimental results suggest the difference in maximum rank-1 accuracy of lightweight LightCNN-29 over best-performing ResNet-50 is \textbf{1.85\%} and the reduction in model parameters is \textbf{23.49M}. Most of the deep models obtained similar performances at rank-5 and rank-10. The inference time of LightCNNs is 2.1x faster than other models on mobile devices. The least performance difference of \textbf{14\%} is noted between LightCNN-29 and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) descriptor at rank-1. In most of the experimental settings, lightweight LightCNN models offered the best trade-off between accuracy and the model size in comparison to most of the models.      
### 60.PrivateSNN: Fully Privacy-Preserving Spiking Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03414.pdf)
>  How can we bring both privacy and energy-efficiency to a neural system on edge devices? In this paper, we propose PrivateSNN, which aims to build low-power Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) from a pre-trained ANN model without leaking sensitive information contained in a dataset. Here, we tackle two types of leakage problems: 1) Data leakage caused when the networks access real training data during an ANN-SNN conversion process. 2) Class leakage is the concept of leakage caused when class-related features can be reconstructed from network parameters. In order to address the data leakage issue, we generate synthetic images from the pre-trained ANNs and convert ANNs to SNNs using generated images. However, converted SNNs are still vulnerable with respect to the class leakage since the weight parameters have the same (or scaled) value with respect to ANN parameters. Therefore, we encrypt SNN weights by training SNNs with a temporal spike-based learning rule. Updating weight parameters with temporal data makes networks difficult to be interpreted in the spatial domain. We observe that the encrypted PrivateSNN can be implemented not only without the huge performance drop (less than ~5%) but also with significant energy-efficiency gain (about x60 compared to the standard ANN). We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, highlighting the importance of privacy-preserving SNN training.      
### 61.Contour Proposal Networks for Biomedical Instance Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03393.pdf)
>  We present a conceptually simple framework for object instance segmentation called Contour Proposal Network (CPN), which detects possibly overlapping objects in an image while simultaneously fitting closed object contours using an interpretable, fixed-sized representation based on Fourier Descriptors. The CPN can incorporate state of the art object detection architectures as backbone networks into a single-stage instance segmentation model that can be trained end-to-end. We construct CPN models with different backbone networks, and apply them to instance segmentation of cells in datasets from different modalities. In our experiments, we show CPNs that outperform U-Nets and Mask R-CNNs in instance segmentation accuracy, and present variants with execution times suitable for real-time applications. The trained models generalize well across different domains of cell types. Since the main assumption of the framework are closed object contours, it is applicable to a wide range of detection problems also outside the biomedical domain. An implementation of the model architecture in PyTorch is freely available.      
### 62.SOLD2: Self-supervised Occlusion-aware Line Description and Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03362.pdf)
>  Compared to feature point detection and description, detecting and matching line segments offer additional challenges. Yet, line features represent a promising complement to points for multi-view tasks. Lines are indeed well-defined by the image gradient, frequently appear even in poorly textured areas and offer robust structural cues. We thus hereby introduce the first joint detection and description of line segments in a single deep network. Thanks to a self-supervised training, our method does not require any annotated line labels and can therefore generalize to any dataset. Our detector offers repeatable and accurate localization of line segments in images, departing from the wireframe parsing approach. Leveraging the recent progresses in descriptor learning, our proposed line descriptor is highly discriminative, while remaining robust to viewpoint changes and occlusions. We evaluate our approach against previous line detection and description methods on several multi-view datasets created with homographic warps as well as real-world viewpoint changes. Our full pipeline yields higher repeatability, localization accuracy and matching metrics, and thus represents a first step to bridge the gap with learned feature points methods.

### 63.Monitoring Social-distance in Wide Areas during Pandemics: a Density Map and Segmentation Approach  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03361.pdf)
>  With the relaxation of the containment measurements around the globe, monitoring the social distancing in crowded public places is of grate importance to prevent a new massive wave of COVID-19 infections. Recent works in that matter have limited themselves by detecting social distancing in corridors up to small crowds by detecting each person individually considering the full body in the image. In this work, we propose a new framework for monitoring the social-distance using end-to-end Deep Learning, to detect crowds violating the social-distance in wide areas where important occlusions may be present. Our framework consists in the creation of a new ground truth based on the ground truth density maps and the proposal of two different solutions, a density-map-based and a segmentation-based, to detect the crowds violating the social-distance constrain. We assess the results of both approaches by using the generated ground truth from the PET2009 and CityStreet datasets. We show that our framework performs well at providing the zones where people are not following the social-distance even when heavily occluded or far away from one camera.      
### 64.OVANet: One-vs-All Network for Universal Domain Adaptation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03344.pdf)
>  Universal Domain Adaptation (UNDA) aims to handle both domain-shift and category-shift between two datasets, where the main challenge is to transfer knowledge while rejecting unknown classes which are absent in the labeled source data but present in the unlabeled target data. Existing methods manually set a threshold to reject unknown samples based on validation or a pre-defined ratio of unknown samples, but this strategy is not practical. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the threshold using source samples and to adapt it to the target domain. Our idea is that a minimum inter-class distance in the source domain should be a good threshold to decide between known or unknown in the target. To learn the inter-and intra-class distance, we propose to train a one-vs-all classifier for each class using labeled source data. Then, we adapt the open-set classifier to the target domain by minimizing class entropy. The resulting framework is the simplest of all baselines of UNDA and is insensitive to the value of a hyper-parameter yet outperforms baselines with a large margin.      
### 65.Automatic Generation of Descriptive Titles for Video Clips Using Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03337.pdf)
>  Over the last decade, the use of Deep Learning in many applications produced results that are comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance. The application domains include diagnosing diseases, finance, agriculture, search engines, robot vision, and many others. In this paper, we are proposing an architecture that utilizes image/video captioning methods and Natural Language Processing systems to generate a title and a concise abstract for a video. Such a system can potentially be utilized in many application domains, including, the cinema industry, video search engines, security surveillance, video databases/warehouses, data centers, and others. The proposed system functions and operates as followed: it reads a video; representative image frames are identified and selected; the image frames are captioned; NLP is applied to all generated captions together with text summarization; and finally, a title and an abstract are generated for the video. All functions are performed automatically. Preliminary results are provided in this paper using publicly available datasets. This paper is not concerned about the efficiency of the system at the execution time. We hope to be able to address execution efficiency issues in our subsequent publications.      
### 66.A transfer-learning approach for lesion detection in endoscopic images from the urinary tract  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03927.pdf)
>  Ureteroscopy and cystoscopy are the gold standard methods to identify and treat tumors along the urinary tract. It has been reported that during a normal procedure a rate of 10-20 % of the lesions could be missed. In this work we study the implementation of 3 different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), using a 2-steps training strategy, to classify images from the urinary tract with and without lesions. A total of 6,101 images from ureteroscopy and cystoscopy procedures were collected. The CNNs were trained and tested using transfer learning in a two-steps fashion on 3 datasets. The datasets used were: 1) only ureteroscopy images, 2) only cystoscopy images and 3) the combination of both of them. For cystoscopy data, VGG performed better obtaining an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) value of 0.846. In the cases of ureteroscopy and the combination of both datasets, ResNet50 achieved the best results with AUC values of 0.987 and 0.940. The use of a training dataset that comprehends both domains results in general better performances, but performing a second stage of transfer learning achieves comparable ones. There is no single model which performs better in all scenarios, but ResNet50 is the network that achieves the best performances in most of them. The obtained results open the opportunity for further investigation with a view for improving lesion detection in endoscopic images of the urinary system.      
### 67.Multimodal Fusion of EMG and Vision for Human Grasp Intent Inference in Prosthetic Hand Control  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03893.pdf)
>  For lower arm amputees, robotic prosthetic hands offer the promise to regain the capability to perform fine object manipulation in activities of daily living. Current control methods based on physiological signals such as EEG and EMG are prone to poor inference outcomes due to motion artifacts, variability of skin electrode junction impedance over time, muscle fatigue, and other factors. Visual evidence is also susceptible to its own artifacts, most often due to object occlusion, lighting changes, variable shapes of objects depending on view-angle, among other factors. Multimodal evidence fusion using physiological and vision sensor measurements is a natural approach due to the complementary strengths of these modalities. <br>In this paper, we present a Bayesian evidence fusion framework for grasp intent inference using eye-view video, gaze, and EMG from the forearm processed by neural network models. We analyze individual and fused performance as a function of time as the hand approaches the object to grasp it. For this purpose, we have also developed novel data processing and augmentation techniques to train neural network components. Our experimental data analyses demonstrate that EMG and visual evidence show complementary strengths, and as a consequence, fusion of multimodal evidence can outperform each individual evidence modality at any given time. Specifically, results indicate that, on average, fusion improves the instantaneous upcoming grasp type classification accuracy while in the reaching phase by 13.66% and 14.8%, relative to EMG and visual evidence individually. An overall fusion accuracy of 95.3% among 13 labels (compared to a chance level of 7.7%) is achieved, and more detailed analysis indicate that the correct grasp is inferred sufficiently early and with high confidence compared to the top contender, in order to allow successful robot actuation to close the loop.      
### 68.Uncertainty-Aware Temporal Self-Learning (UATS): Semi-Supervised Learning for Segmentation of Prostate Zones and Beyond  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03840.pdf)
>  Various convolutional neural network (CNN) based concepts have been introduced for the prostate's automatic segmentation and its coarse subdivision into transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ). However, when targeting a fine-grained segmentation of TZ, PZ, distal prostatic urethra (DPU) and the anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFS), the task becomes more challenging and has not yet been solved at the level of human performance. One reason might be the insufficient amount of labeled data for supervised training. Therefore, we propose to apply a semi-supervised learning (SSL) technique named uncertainty-aware temporal self-learning (UATS) to overcome the expensive and time-consuming manual ground truth labeling. We combine the SSL techniques temporal ensembling and uncertainty-guided self-learning to benefit from unlabeled images, which are often readily available. Our method significantly outperforms the supervised baseline and obtained a Dice coefficient (DC) of up to 78.9% , 87.3%, 75.3%, 50.6% for TZ, PZ, DPU and AFS, respectively. The obtained results are in the range of human inter-rater performance for all structures. Moreover, we investigate the method's robustness against noise and demonstrate the generalization capability for varying ratios of labeled data and on other challenging tasks, namely the hippocampus and skin lesion segmentation. UATS achieved superiority segmentation quality compared to the supervised baseline, particularly for minimal amounts of labeled data.      
### 69.BEFD: Boundary Enhancement and Feature Denoising for Vessel Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03768.pdf)
>  Blood vessel segmentation is crucial for many diagnostic and research applications. In recent years, CNN-based models have leaded to breakthroughs in the task of segmentation, however, such methods usually lose high-frequency information like object boundaries and subtle structures, which are vital to vessel segmentation. To tackle this issue, we propose Boundary Enhancement and Feature Denoising (BEFD) module to facilitate the network ability of extracting boundary information in semantic segmentation, which can be integrated into arbitrary encoder-decoder architecture in an end-to-end way. By introducing Sobel edge detector, the network is able to acquire additional edge prior, thus enhancing boundary in an unsupervised manner for medical image segmentation. In addition, we also utilize a denoising block to reduce the noise hidden in the low-level features. Experimental results on retinal vessel dataset and angiocarpy dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the new BEFD module.      
### 70.CARRNN: A Continuous Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Network for Deep Representation Learning from Sporadic Temporal Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03739.pdf)
>  Learning temporal patterns from multivariate longitudinal data is challenging especially in cases when data is sporadic, as often seen in, e.g., healthcare applications where the data can suffer from irregularity and asynchronicity as the time between consecutive data points can vary across features and samples, hindering the application of existing deep learning models that are constructed for complete, evenly spaced data with fixed sequence lengths. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model is developed for modeling multiple temporal features in sporadic data using an integrated deep learning architecture based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) unit and a continuous-time autoregressive (CAR) model. The proposed model, called CARRNN, uses a generalized discrete-time autoregressive model that is trainable end-to-end using neural networks modulated by time lags to describe the changes caused by the irregularity and asynchronicity. It is applied to multivariate time-series regression tasks using data provided for Alzheimer's disease progression modeling and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate prediction, where the proposed model based on a gated recurrent unit (GRU) achieves the lowest prediction errors among the proposed RNN-based models and state-of-the-art methods using GRUs and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in their architecture.      
### 71.Support-Target Protocol for Meta-Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03736.pdf)
>  The support/query (S/Q) training protocol is widely used in meta-learning. S/Q protocol trains a task-specific model on S and then evaluates it on Q to optimize the meta-model using query loss, which depends on size and quality of Q. In this paper, we study a new S/T protocol for meta-learning. Assuming that we have access to the theoretically optimal model T for a task, we can directly match the task-specific model trained on S to T. S/T protocol offers a more accurate evaluation since it does not rely on possibly biased and noisy query instances. There are two challenges in putting S/T protocol into practice. Firstly, we have to determine how to match the task-specific model to T. To this end, we minimize the discrepancy between them on a fictitious dataset generated by adversarial learning, and distill the prediction ability of T to the task-specific model. Secondly, we usually do not have ready-made optimal models. As an alternative, we construct surrogate target models by fine-tuning on local tasks the globally pre-trained meta-model, maintaining both efficiency and veracity.      
### 72.On tuning consistent annealed sampling for denoising score matching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03725.pdf)
>  Score-based generative models provide state-of-the-art quality for image and audio synthesis. Sampling from these models is performed iteratively, typically employing a discretized series of noise levels and a predefined scheme. In this note, we first overview three common sampling schemes for models trained with denoising score matching. Next, we focus on one of them, consistent annealed sampling, and study its hyper-parameter boundaries. We then highlight a possible formulation of such hyper-parameter that explicitly considers those boundaries and facilitates tuning when using few or a variable number of steps. Finally, we highlight some connections of the formulation with other sampling schemes.      
### 73.Atrous Residual Interconnected Encoder to Attention Decoder Framework for Vertebrae Segmentation via 3D Volumetric CT Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03715.pdf)
>  Automatic medical image segmentation based on Computed Tomography (CT) has been widely applied for computer-aided surgery as a prerequisite. With the development of deep learning technologies, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have shown robust performance in automated semantic segmentation of medical images. However, semantic segmentation algorithms based on DCNNs still meet the challenges of feature loss between encoder and decoder, multi-scale object, restricted field of view of filters, and lack of medical image data. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for automated vertebrae segmentation via 3D volumetric spine CT images. The proposed model is based on the structure of encoder to decoder, using layer normalization to optimize mini-batch training performance. To address the concern of the information loss between encoder and decoder, we designed an Atrous Residual Path to pass more features from encoder to decoder instead of an easy shortcut connection. The proposed model also applied the attention module in the decoder part to extract features from variant scales. The proposed model is evaluated on a publicly available dataset by a variety of metrics. The experimental results show that our model achieves competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art medical semantic segmentation methods.      
### 74.Advanced Image Enhancement Method for Distant Vessels and Structures in Capsule Endoscopy  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03668.pdf)
>  This paper proposes an advanced method for contrast enhancement of capsule endoscopic images, with the main objective to obtain sufficient information about the vessels and structures in more distant (or darker) parts of capsule endoscopic images. The proposed method (PM) combines two algorithms for the enhancement of darker and brighter areas of capsule endoscopic images, respectively. The half-unit weighted bilinear algorithm (HWB) proposed in our previous work is used to enhance darker areas according to the darker map content of its HSV's component V. Enhancement of brighter areas is achieved thanks to the novel thresholded weighted-bilinear algorithm (TWB) developed to avoid overexposure and enlargement of specular highlight spots while preserving the hue, in such areas. The TWB performs enhancement operations following a gradual increment of the brightness of the brighter map content of its HSV's component V. In other words, the TWB decreases its averaged-weights as the intensity content of the component V increases. Extensive experimental demonstrations were conducted, and based on evaluation of the reference and PM enhanced images, a gastroenterologist (ØH) concluded that the PM enhanced images were the best ones based on the information about the vessels, contrast in the images, and the view or visibility of the structures in more distant parts of the capsule endoscopy images.      
### 75.Contextual Semi-Supervised Learning: An Approach To Leverage Air-Surveillance and Untranscribed ATC Data in ASR Systems  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03643.pdf)
>  Air traffic management and specifically air-traffic control (ATC) rely mostly on voice communications between Air Traffic Controllers (ATCos) and pilots. In most cases, these voice communications follow a well-defined grammar that could be leveraged in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. The callsign used to address an airplane is an essential part of all ATCo-pilot communications. We propose a two-steps approach to add contextual knowledge during semi-supervised training to reduce the ASR system error rates at recognizing the part of the utterance that contains the callsign. Initially, we represent in a WFST the contextual knowledge (i.e. air-surveillance data) of an ATCo-pilot communication. Then, during Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) the contextual knowledge is added by second-pass decoding (i.e. lattice re-scoring). Results show that `unseen domains' (e.g. data from airports not present in the supervised training data) are further aided by contextual SSL when compared to standalone SSL. For this task, we introduce the Callsign Word Error Rate (CA-WER) as an evaluation metric, which only assesses ASR performance of the spoken callsign in an utterance. We obtained a 32.1% CA-WER relative improvement applying SSL with an additional 17.5% CA-WER improvement by adding contextual knowledge during SSL on a challenging ATC-based test set gathered from LiveATC.      
### 76.DeepProg: A Transformer-based Framework for Predicting Disease Prognosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03642.pdf)
>  A vast majority of deep learning methods are built to automate diagnostic tasks. However, in clinical practice, a more advanced question is how to predict the course of a disease. Current methods for this problem are complicated, and often require domain knowledge, making them difficult for practitioners to use. In this paper, we formulate the prognosis prediction task as a one-to-many sequence prediction problem. Inspired by a clinical decision making process with two agents -- a radiologist and a general practitioner -- we propose a generic end-to-end transformer-based framework to estimate disease prognosis from images and auxiliary data. The effectiveness and validation of the developed method are shown on synthetic data, and in the task of predicting the development of structural osteoarthritic changes in knee joints.      
### 77.Spatial Imagination With Semantic Cognition for Mobile Robots  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03638.pdf)
>  The imagination of the surrounding environment based on experience and semantic cognition has great potential to extend the limited observations and provide more information for mapping, collision avoidance, and path planning. This paper provides a training-based algorithm for mobile robots to perform spatial imagination based on semantic cognition and evaluates the proposed method for the mapping task. We utilize a photo-realistic simulation environment, Habitat, for training and evaluation. The trained model is composed of Resent-18 as encoder and Unet as the backbone. We demonstrate that the algorithm can perform imagination for unseen parts of the object universally, by recalling the images and experience and compare our approach with traditional semantic mapping methods. It is found that our approach will improve the efficiency and accuracy of semantic mapping.      
### 78.MRI-based Alzheimer's disease prediction via distilling the knowledge in multi-modal data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03618.pdf)
>  Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction, i.e., identifying MCI patients of high risks converting to Alzheimer's disease (AD), is essential for preventing or slowing the progression of AD. Although previous studies have shown that the fusion of multi-modal data can effectively improve the prediction accuracy, their applications are largely restricted by the limited availability or high cost of multi-modal data. Building an effective prediction model using only magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains a challenging research topic. In this work, we propose a multi-modal multi-instance distillation scheme, which aims to distill the knowledge learned from multi-modal data to an MRI-based network for MCI conversion prediction. In contrast to existing distillation algorithms, the proposed multi-instance probabilities demonstrate a superior capability of representing the complicated atrophy distributions, and can guide the MRI-based network to better explore the input MRI. To our best knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to improve an MRI-based prediction model by leveraging extra supervision distilled from multi-modal information. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of our framework, suggesting its potentials in the data-limited clinical settings.      
### 79.Stable deep neural network architectures for mitochondria segmentation on electron microscopy volumes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03577.pdf)
>  Electron microscopy (EM) allows the identification of intracellular organelles such as mitochondria, providing insights for clinical and scientific studies. In recent years, a number of novel deep learning architectures have been published reporting superior performance, or even human-level accuracy, compared to previous approaches on public mitochondria segmentation datasets. Unfortunately, many of these publications do not make neither the code nor the full training details public to support the results obtained, leading to reproducibility issues and dubious model comparisons. For that reason, and following a recent code of best practices for reporting experimental results, we present an extensive study of the state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for the segmentation of mitochondria on EM volumes, and evaluate the impact in performance of different variations of 2D and 3D U-Net-like models for this task. To better understand the contribution of each component, a common set of pre- and post-processing operations has been implemented and tested with each approach. Moreover, an exhaustive sweep of hyperparameters values for all architectures have been performed and each configuration has been run multiple times to report the mean and standard deviation values of the evaluation metrics. Using this methodology, we found very stable architectures and hyperparameter configurations that consistently obtain state-of-the-art results in the well-known EPFL Hippocampus mitochondria segmentation dataset. Furthermore, we have benchmarked our proposed models on two other available datasets, Lucchi++ and Kasthuri++, where they outperform all previous works. The code derived from this research and its documentation are publicly available.      
### 80.M-Net with Bidirectional ConvLSTM for Cup and Disc Segmentation in Fundus Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03549.pdf)
>  Glaucoma is a severe eye disease that is known to deteriorate optic never fibers, causing cup size to increase, which could result in permanent loss of vision. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness after cataract, but glaucoma being more dangerous as it is not curable. Early diagnoses and treatment of glaucoma can help to slow the progression of glaucoma and its damages. For the detection of glaucoma, the Cup to Disc ratio (CDR) provides significant information. The CDR depends heavily on the accurate segmentation of cup and disc regions. In this paper, we have proposed a modified M-Net with bidirectional convolution long short-term memory (LSTM), based on joint cup and disc segmentation. The proposed network combines features of encoder and decoder, with bidirectional LSTM. Our proposed model segments cup and disc regions based on which the abnormalities in cup to disc ratio can be observed. The proposed model is tested on REFUGE2 data, where our model achieves a dice score of 0.92 for optic disc and an accuracy of 98.99% in segmenting cup and disc regions      
### 81.An Object Detection based Solver for Google's Image reCAPTCHA v2  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.03366.pdf)
>  Previous work showed that reCAPTCHA v2's image challenges could be solved by automated programs armed with Deep Neural Network (DNN) image classifiers and vision APIs provided by off-the-shelf image recognition services. In response to emerging threats, Google has made significant updates to its image reCAPTCHA v2 challenges that can render the prior approaches ineffective to a great extent. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of the latest version of reCAPTCHA v2 against advanced object detection based solvers. We propose a fully automated object detection based system that breaks the most advanced challenges of reCAPTCHA v2 with an online success rate of 83.25%, the highest success rate to date, and it takes only 19.93 seconds (including network delays) on average to crack a challenge. We also study the updated security features of reCAPTCHA v2, such as anti-recognition mechanisms, improved anti-bot detection techniques, and adjustable security preferences. Our extensive experiments show that while these security features can provide some resistance against automated attacks, adversaries can still bypass most of them. Our experimental findings indicate that the recent advances in object detection technologies pose a severe threat to the security of image captcha designs relying on simple object detection as their underlying AI problem.
