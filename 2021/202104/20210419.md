### 1.Fusing the Old with the New: Learning Relative Camera Pose with Geometry-Guided Uncertainty  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08278.pdf)
>  Learning methods for relative camera pose estimation have been developed largely in isolation from classical geometric approaches. The question of how to integrate predictions from deep neural networks (DNNs) and solutions from geometric solvers, such as the 5-point algorithm, has as yet remained under-explored. In this paper, we present a novel framework that involves probabilistic fusion between the two families of predictions during network training, with a view to leveraging their complementary benefits in a learnable way. The fusion is achieved by learning the DNN uncertainty under explicit guidance by the geometric uncertainty, thereby learning to take into account the geometric solution in relation to the DNN prediction. Our network features a self-attention graph neural network, which drives the learning by enforcing strong interactions between different correspondences and potentially modeling complex relationships between points. We propose motion parmeterizations suitable for learning and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DeMoN and ScanNet datasets. While we focus on relative pose, we envision that our pipeline is broadly applicable for fusing classical geometry and deep learning.      
### 2.Divide-and-Conquer for Lane-Aware Diverse Trajectory Prediction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08277.pdf)
>  Trajectory prediction is a safety-critical tool for autonomous vehicles to plan and execute actions. Our work addresses two key challenges in trajectory prediction, learning multimodal outputs, and better predictions by imposing constraints using driving knowledge. Recent methods have achieved strong performances using Multi-Choice Learning objectives like winner-takes-all (WTA) or best-of-many. But the impact of those methods in learning diverse hypotheses is under-studied as such objectives highly depend on their initialization for diversity. As our first contribution, we propose a novel Divide-And-Conquer (DAC) approach that acts as a better initialization technique to WTA objective, resulting in diverse outputs without any spurious modes. Our second contribution is a novel trajectory prediction framework called ALAN that uses existing lane centerlines as anchors to provide trajectories constrained to the input lanes. Our framework provides multi-agent trajectory outputs in a forward pass by capturing interactions through hypercolumn descriptors and incorporating scene information in the form of rasterized images and per-agent lane anchors. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that the proposed DAC captures the data distribution better compare to other WTA family of objectives. Further, we show that our ALAN approach provides on par or better performance with SOTA methods evaluated on Nuscenes urban driving benchmark.      
### 3.TEACHTEXT: CrossModal Generalized Distillation for Text-Video Retrieval  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08271.pdf)
>  In recent years, considerable progress on the task of text-video retrieval has been achieved by leveraging large-scale pretraining on visual and audio datasets to construct powerful video encoders. By contrast, despite the natural symmetry, the design of effective algorithms for exploiting large-scale language pretraining remains under-explored. In this work, we are the first to investigate the design of such algorithms and propose a novel generalized distillation method, TeachText, which leverages complementary cues from multiple text encoders to provide an enhanced supervisory signal to the retrieval model. Moreover, we extend our method to video side modalities and show that we can effectively reduce the number of used modalities at test time without compromising performance. Our approach advances the state of the art on several video retrieval benchmarks by a significant margin and adds no computational overhead at test time. Last but not least, we show an effective application of our method for eliminating noise from retrieval datasets.

### 4.Open data for Moroccan license plates for OCR applications : data collection, labeling, and model construction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08244.pdf)
>  Significant number of researches have been developed recently around intelligent system for traffic management, especially, OCR based license plate recognition, as it is considered as a main step for any automatic traffic management system. Good quality data sets are increasingly needed and produced by the research community to improve the performance of those algorithms. Furthermore, a special need of data is noted for countries having special characters on their licence plates, like Morocco, where Arabic Alphabet is used. In this work, we present a labeled open data set of circulation plates taken in Morocco, for different type of vehicles, namely cars, trucks and motorcycles. This data was collected manually and consists of 705 unique and different images. Furthermore this data was labeled for plate segmentation and for matriculation number OCR. Also, As we show in this paper, the data can be enriched using data augmentation techniques to create training sets with few thousands of images for different machine leaning and AI applications. We present and compare a set of models built on this data. Also, we publish this data as an open access data to encourage innovation and applications in the field of OCR and image processing for traffic control and other applications for transportation and heterogeneous vehicle management.      
### 5.Spatial-Temporal Correlation and Topology Learning for Person Re-Identification in Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08241.pdf)
>  Video-based person re-identification aims to match pedestrians from video sequences across non-overlapping camera views. The key factor for video person re-identification is to effectively exploit both spatial and temporal clues from video sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Correlation and Topology Learning framework (CTL) to pursue discriminative and robust representation by modeling cross-scale spatial-temporal correlation. Specifically, CTL utilizes a CNN backbone and a key-points estimator to extract semantic local features from human body at multiple granularities as graph nodes. It explores a context-reinforced topology to construct multi-scale graphs by considering both global contextual information and physical connections of human body. Moreover, a 3D graph convolution and a cross-scale graph convolution are designed, which facilitate direct cross-spacetime and cross-scale information propagation for capturing hierarchical spatial-temporal dependencies and structural information. By jointly performing the two convolutions, CTL effectively mines comprehensive clues that are complementary with appearance information to enhance representational capacity. Extensive experiments on two video benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and the state-of-the-art performance.      
### 6.Point-Based Modeling of Human Clothing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08230.pdf)
>  We propose a new approach to human clothing modeling based on point clouds. Within this approach, we learn a deep model that can predict point clouds of various outfits, for various human poses and for various human body shapes. Notably, outfits of various types and topologies can be handled by the same model. Using the learned model, we can infer geometry of new outfits from as little as a singe image, and perform outfit retargeting to new bodies in new poses. We complement our geometric model with appearance modeling that uses the point cloud geometry as a geometric scaffolding, and employs neural point-based graphics to capture outfit appearance from videos and to re-render the captured outfits. We validate both geometric modeling and appearance modeling aspects of the proposed approach against recently proposed methods, and establish the viability of point-based clothing modeling.      
### 7.MeshTalk: 3D Face Animation from Speech using Cross-Modality Disentanglement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08223.pdf)
>  This paper presents a generic method for generating full facial 3D animation from speech. Existing approaches to audio-driven facial animation exhibit uncanny or static upper face animation, fail to produce accurate and plausible co-articulation or rely on person-specific models that limit their scalability. To improve upon existing models, we propose a generic audio-driven facial animation approach that achieves highly realistic motion synthesis results for the entire face. At the core of our approach is a categorical latent space for facial animation that disentangles audio-correlated and audio-uncorrelated information based on a novel cross-modality loss. Our approach ensures highly accurate lip motion, while also synthesizing plausible animation of the parts of the face that are uncorrelated to the audio signal, such as eye blinks and eye brow motion. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms several baselines and obtains state-of-the-art quality both qualitatively and quantitatively. A perceptual user study demonstrates that our approach is deemed more realistic than the current state-of-the-art in over 75% of cases. We recommend watching the supplemental video before reading the paper: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mesh_talk.mp4" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>      
### 8.Semantic Image Matting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08201.pdf)
>  Natural image matting separates the foreground from background in fractional occupancy which can be caused by highly transparent objects, complex foreground (e.g., net or tree), and/or objects containing very fine details (e.g., hairs). Although conventional matting formulation can be applied to all of the above cases, no previous work has attempted to reason the underlying causes of matting due to various foreground semantics. <br>We show how to obtain better alpha mattes by incorporating into our framework semantic classification of matting regions. Specifically, we consider and learn 20 classes of matting patterns, and propose to extend the conventional trimap to semantic trimap. The proposed semantic trimap can be obtained automatically through patch structure analysis within trimap regions. Meanwhile, we learn a multi-class discriminator to regularize the alpha prediction at semantic level, and content-sensitive weights to balance different regularization losses. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our method outperforms other methods and has achieved the most competitive state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we contribute a large-scale Semantic Image Matting Dataset with careful consideration of data balancing across different semantic classes.      
### 9.Spatiotemporal Deformable Models for Long-Term Complex Activity Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08194.pdf)
>  Long-term complex activity recognition and localisation can be crucial for the decision-making process of several autonomous systems, such as smart cars and surgical robots. Nonetheless, most current methods are designed to merely localise short-term action/activities or combinations of atomic actions that only last for a few frames or seconds. In this paper, we address the problem of long-term complex activity detection via a novel deformable, spatiotemporal parts-based model. Our framework consists of three main building blocks: (i) action tube detection, (ii) the modelling of the deformable geometry of parts, and (iii) a sparsity mechanism. Firstly, action tubes are detected in a series of snippets using an action tube detector. Next, a new 3D deformable RoI pooling layer is designed for learning the flexible, deformable geometry of the constellation of parts. Finally, a sparsity strategy differentiates between activated and deactivate features. We also provide temporal complex activity annotation for the recently released ROAD autonomous driving dataset and the SARAS-ESAD surgical action dataset, to validate our method and show the adaptability of our framework to different domains. As they both contain long videos portraying long-term activities they can be used as benchmarks for future work in this area.      
### 10.I Find Your Lack of Uncertainty in Computer Vision Disturbing  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08188.pdf)
>  Neural networks are used for many real world applications, but often they have problems estimating their own confidence. This is particularly problematic for computer vision applications aimed at making high stakes decisions with humans and their lives. In this paper we make a meta-analysis of the literature, showing that most if not all computer vision applications do not use proper epistemic uncertainty quantification, which means that these models ignore their own limitations. We describe the consequences of using models without proper uncertainty quantification, and motivate the community to adopt versions of the models they use that have proper calibrated epistemic uncertainty, in order to enable out of distribution detection. We close the paper with a summary of challenges on estimating uncertainty for computer vision applications and recommendations.      
### 11.Shadow-Mapping for Unsupervised Neural Causal Discovery  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08183.pdf)
>  An important goal across most scientific fields is the discovery of causal structures underling a set of observations. Unfortunately, causal discovery methods which are based on correlation or mutual information can often fail to identify causal links in systems which exhibit dynamic relationships. Such dynamic systems (including the famous coupled logistic map) exhibit `mirage' correlations which appear and disappear depending on the observation window. This means not only that correlation is not causation but, perhaps counter-intuitively, that causation may occur without correlation. In this paper we describe Neural Shadow-Mapping, a neural network based method which embeds high-dimensional video data into a low-dimensional shadow representation, for subsequent estimation of causal links. We demonstrate its performance at discovering causal links from video-representations of dynamic systems.      
### 12.Locally Aware Piecewise Transformation Fields for 3D Human Mesh Registration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08160.pdf)
>  Registering point clouds of dressed humans to parametric human models is a challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches often rely on heavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization of human poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methods are proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that pose initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, regressing joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields (PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently, rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences, circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and results in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the parameters compared with the state-of-the-art. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that fitting parametric models with poses initialized by our network results in much better registration quality, especially for extreme poses.      
### 13.Exploiting Global and Local Attentions for Heavy Rain Removal on Single Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08126.pdf)
>  Heavy rain removal from a single image is the task of simultaneously eliminating rain streaks and fog, which can dramatically degrade the quality of captured images. Most existing rain removal methods do not generalize well for the heavy rain case. In this work, we propose a novel network architecture consisting of three sub-networks to remove heavy rain from a single image without estimating rain streaks and fog separately. The first sub-net, a U-net-based architecture that incorporates our Spatial Channel Attention (SCA) blocks, extracts global features that provide sufficient contextual information needed to remove atmospheric distortions caused by rain and fog. The second sub-net learns the additive residues information, which is useful in removing rain streak artifacts via our proposed Residual Inception Modules (RIM). The third sub-net, the multiplicative sub-net, adopts our Channel-attentive Inception Modules (CIM) and learns the essential brighter local features which are not effectively extracted in the SCA and additive sub-nets by modulating the local pixel intensities in the derained images. Our three clean image results are then combined via an attentive blending block to generate the final clean image. Our method with SCA, RIM, and CIM significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art single-image deraining methods on the synthetic datasets, shows considerably cleaner and sharper derained estimates on the real image datasets. We present extensive experiments and ablation studies supporting each of our method's contributions on both synthetic and real image datasets.      
### 14.Grassmann Iterative Linear Discriminant Analysis with Proxy Matrix Optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08112.pdf)
>  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is commonly used for dimensionality reduction in pattern recognition and statistics. It is a supervised method that aims to find the most discriminant space of reduced dimension that can be further used for classification. In this work, we present a Grassmann Iterative LDA method (GILDA) that is based on Proxy Matrix Optimization (PMO). PMO makes use of automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the Grassmann manifold to arrive at the optimal projection matrix. Our results show that GILDAoutperforms the prevailing manifold optimization method.      
### 15.Cross-Modal Retrieval Augmentation for Multi-Modal Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08108.pdf)
>  Recent advances in using retrieval components over external knowledge sources have shown impressive results for a variety of downstream tasks in natural language processing. Here, we explore the use of unstructured external knowledge sources of images and their corresponding captions for improving visual question answering (VQA). First, we train a novel alignment model for embedding images and captions in the same space, which achieves substantial improvement in performance on image-caption retrieval w.r.t. similar methods. Second, we show that retrieval-augmented multi-modal transformers using the trained alignment model improve results on VQA over strong baselines. We further conduct extensive experiments to establish the promise of this approach, and examine novel applications for inference time such as hot-swapping indices.      
### 16.Multiple feature fusion-based video face tracking for IoT big data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08096.pdf)
>  With the advancement of IoT and artificial intelligence technologies, and the need for rapid application growth in fields such as security entrance control and financial business trade, facial information processing has become an important means for achieving identity authentication and information security. In this paper, we propose a multi-feature fusion algorithm based on integral histograms and a real-time update tracking particle filtering module. First, edge and colour features are extracted, weighting methods are used to weight the colour histogram and edge features to describe facial features, and fusion of colour and edge features is made adaptive by using fusion coefficients to improve face tracking reliability. Then, the integral histogram is integrated into the particle filtering algorithm to simplify the calculation steps of complex particles. Finally, the tracking window size is adjusted in real time according to the change in the average distance from the particle centre to the edge of the current model and the initial model to reduce the drift problem and achieve stable tracking with significant changes in the target dimension. The results show that the algorithm improves video tracking accuracy, simplifies particle operation complexity, improves the speed, and has good anti-interference ability and robustness.      
### 17.ScreenSeg: On-Device Screenshot Layout Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08052.pdf)
>  We propose a novel end-to-end solution that performs a Hierarchical Layout Analysis of screenshots and document images on resource constrained devices like mobilephones. Our approach segments entities like Grid, Image, Text and Icon blocks occurring in a screenshot. We provide an option for smart editing by auto highlighting these entities for saving or sharing. Further this multi-level layout analysis of screenshots has many use cases including content extraction, keyword-based image search, style transfer, etc. We have addressed the limitations of known baseline approaches, supported a wide variety of semantically complex screenshots, and developed an approach which is highly optimized for on-device deployment. In addition, we present a novel weighted NMS technique for filtering object proposals. We achieve an average precision of about 0.95 with a latency of around 200ms on Samsung Galaxy S10 Device for a screenshot of 1080p resolution. The solution pipeline is already commercialized in Samsung Device applications i.e. Samsung Capture, Smart Crop, My Filter in Camera Application, Bixby Touch.      
### 18.TeLCoS: OnDevice Text Localization with Clustering of Script  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08045.pdf)
>  Recent research in the field of text localization in a resource constrained environment has made extensive use of deep neural networks. Scene text localization and recognition on low-memory mobile devices have a wide range of applications including content extraction, image categorization and keyword based image search. For text recognition of multi-lingual localized text, the OCR systems require prior knowledge of the script of each text instance. This leads to word script identification being an essential step for text recognition. Most existing methods treat text localization, script identification and text recognition as three separate tasks. This makes script identification an overhead in the recognition pipeline. To reduce this overhead, we propose TeLCoS: OnDevice Text Localization with Clustering of Script, a multi-task dual branch lightweight CNN network that performs real-time on device Text Localization and High-level Script Clustering simultaneously. The network drastically reduces the number of calls to a separate script identification module, by grouping and identifying some majorly used scripts through a single feed-forward pass over the localization network. We also introduce a novel structural similarity based channel pruning mechanism to build an efficient network with only 1.15M parameters. Experiments on benchmark datasets suggest that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with execution latency of 60 ms for the entire pipeline on the Exynos 990 chipset device.      
### 19.Noise-Aware Saliency Prediction for Videos with Incomplete Gaze Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08038.pdf)
>  Deep-learning-based algorithms have led to impressive results in visual-saliency prediction, but the impact of noise in training gaze data has been largely overlooked. This issue is especially relevant for videos, where the gaze data tends to be incomplete, and thus noisier, compared to images. Therefore, we propose a noise-aware training (NAT) paradigm for visual-saliency prediction that quantifies the uncertainty arising from gaze data incompleteness and inaccuracy, and accounts for it in training. We demonstrate the advantage of NAT independently of the adopted model architecture, loss function, or training dataset. Given its robustness to the noise in incomplete training datasets, NAT ushers in the possibility of designing gaze datasets with fewer human subjects. We also introduce the first dataset that offers a video-game context for video-saliency research, with rich temporal semantics, and multiple gaze attractors per frame.      
### 20.Temporally smooth online action detection using cycle-consistent future anticipation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08030.pdf)
>  Many video understanding tasks work in the offline setting by assuming that the input video is given from the start to the end. However, many real-world problems require the online setting, making a decision immediately using only the current and the past frames of videos such as in autonomous driving and surveillance systems. In this paper, we present a novel solution for online action detection by using a simple yet effective RNN-based networks called the Future Anticipation and Temporally Smoothing network (FATSnet). The proposed network consists of a module for anticipating the future that can be trained in an unsupervised manner with the cycle-consistency loss, and another component for aggregating the past and the future for temporally smooth frame-by-frame predictions. We also propose a solution to relieve the performance loss when running RNN-based models on very long sequences. Evaluations on TVSeries, THUMOS14, and BBDB show that our method achieve the state-of-the-art performances compared to the previous works on online action detection.      
### 21.T-LEAP: occlusion-robust pose estimation of walking cows using temporal information  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08029.pdf)
>  As herd size on dairy farms continue to increase, automatic health monitoring of cows has gained in interest. Lameness, a prevalent health disorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing the gait of cows. A cow's gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models learn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most animal pose estimation models are static, that is, videos are processed frame by frame and do not use any temporal information. In this work, a static deep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal model that includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the static and temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples of 4 consecutive frames extracted from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy cows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments are prone to occlusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by adding artificial occlusions to the videos. The experiments showed that, on non-occluded data, both static and temporal approaches achieved a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our temporal approach outperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data is beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as dairy farms. The generalization capabilities of the temporal model was evaluated by testing it on data containing unknown cows (cows not present in the training set). The results showed that the average detection rate (PCKh@0.2) was of 93.8% on known cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model is capable of generalizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new herds. Finally, we showed that with harder tasks, such as occlusions and unknown cows, a deeper architecture was more beneficial.      
### 22.Learning Implicit 3D Representations of Dressed Humans from Sparse Views  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08013.pdf)
>  Recently, data-driven single-view reconstruction methods have shown great progress in modeling 3D dressed humans. However, such methods suffer heavily from depth ambiguities and occlusions inherent to single view inputs. In this paper, we address such issues by lifting the single-view input with additional views and investigate the best strategy to suitably exploit information from multiple views. We propose an end-to-end approach that learns an implicit 3D representation of dressed humans from sparse camera views. Specifically, we introduce two key components: first an attention-based fusion layer that learns to aggregate visual information from several viewpoints; second a mechanism that encodes local 3D patterns under the multi-view context. In the experiments, we show the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art on standard data both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we apply our method on real data acquired with a multi-camera platform and demonstrate our approach can obtain results comparable to multi-view stereo with dramatically less views.      
### 23.Write-a-speaker: Text-based Emotional and Rhythmic Talking-head Generation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07995.pdf)
>  In this paper, we propose a novel text-based talking-head video generation framework that synthesizes high-fidelity facial expressions and head motions in accordance with contextual sentiments as well as speech rhythm and pauses. To be specific, our framework consists of a speaker-independent stage and a speaker-specific stage. In the speaker-independent stage, we design three parallel networks to generate animation parameters of the mouth, upper face, and head from texts, separately. In the speaker-specific stage, we present a 3D face model guided attention network to synthesize videos tailored for different individuals. It takes the animation parameters as input and exploits an attention mask to manipulate facial expression changes for the input individuals. Furthermore, to better establish authentic correspondences between visual motions (i.e., facial expression changes and head movements) and audios, we leverage a high-accuracy motion capture dataset instead of relying on long videos of specific individuals. After attaining the visual and audio correspondences, we can effectively train our network in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves high-quality photo-realistic talking-head videos including various facial expressions and head motions according to speech rhythms and outperforms the state-of-the-art.      
### 24.Self-supervised Video Retrieval Transformer Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07993.pdf)
>  Content-based video retrieval aims to find videos from a large video database that are similar to or even near-duplicate of a given query video. Video representation and similarity search algorithms are crucial to any video retrieval system. To derive effective video representation, most video retrieval systems require a large amount of manually annotated data for training, making it costly inefficient. In addition, most retrieval systems are based on frame-level features for video similarity searching, making it expensive both storage wise and search wise. We propose a novel video retrieval system, termed SVRTN, that effectively addresses the above shortcomings. It first applies self-supervised training to effectively learn video representation from unlabeled data to avoid the expensive cost of manual annotation. Then, it exploits transformer structure to aggregate frame-level features into clip-level to reduce both storage space and search complexity. It can learn the complementary and discriminative information from the interactions among clip frames, as well as acquire the frame permutation and missing invariant ability to support more flexible retrieval manners. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging video retrieval datasets, namely FIVR-200K and SVD, verify the effectiveness of our proposed SVRTN method, which achieves the best performance of video retrieval on accuracy and efficiency.      
### 25.Learning to Reconstruct 3D Non-Cuboid Room Layout from a Single RGB Image  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07986.pdf)
>  Single-image room layout reconstruction aims to reconstruct the enclosed 3D structure of a room from a single image. Most previous work relies on the cuboid-shape prior. This paper considers a more general indoor assumption, i.e., the room layout consists of a single ceiling, a single floor, and several vertical walls. To this end, we first employ Convolutional Neural Networks to detect planes and vertical lines between adjacent walls. Meanwhile, estimating the 3D parameters for each plane. Then, a simple yet effective geometric reasoning method is adopted to achieve room layout reconstruction. Furthermore, we optimize the 3D plane parameters to reconstruct a geometrically consistent room layout between planes and lines. The experimental results on public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.      
### 26.Occlusion-aware Visual Tracker using Spatial Structural Information and Dominant Features  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07977.pdf)
>  To overcome the problem of occlusion in visual tracking, this paper proposes an occlusion-aware tracking algorithm. The proposed algorithm divides the object into discrete image patches according to the pixel distribution of the object by means of clustering. To avoid the drifting of the tracker to false targets, the proposed algorithm extracts the dominant features, such as color histogram or histogram of oriented gradient orientation, from these image patches, and uses them as cues for tracking. To enhance the robustness of the tracker, the proposed algorithm employs an implicit spatial structure between these patches as another cue for tracking; Afterwards, the proposed algorithm incorporates these components into the particle filter framework, which results in a robust and precise tracker. Experimental results on color image sequences with different resolutions show that the proposed tracker outperforms the comparison algorithms on handling occlusion in visual tracking.      
### 27.Advanced Deep Networks for 3D Mitochondria Instance Segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07961.pdf)
>  Mitochondria instance segmentation from electron microscopy (EM) images has seen notable progress since the introduction of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose two advanced deep networks, named Res-UNet-R and Res-UNet-H, for 3D mitochondria instance segmentation from Rat and Human samples. Specifically, we design a simple yet effective anisotropic convolution block and deploy a multi-scale training strategy, which together boost the segmentation performance. Moreover, we enhance the generalizability of the trained models on the test set by adding a denoising operation as pre-processing. In the Large-scale 3D Mitochondria Instance Segmentation Challenge, our team ranks the 1st on the leaderboard at the end of the testing phase.

### 28.OmniFlow: Human Omnidirectional Optical Flow  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07960.pdf)
>  Optical flow is the motion of a pixel between at least two consecutive video frames and can be estimated through an end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network. To this end, large training datasets are required to improve the accuracy of optical flow estimation. Our paper presents OmniFlow: a new synthetic omnidirectional human optical flow dataset. Based on a rendering engine we create a naturalistic 3D indoor environment with textured rooms, characters, actions, objects, illumination and motion blur where all components of the environment are shuffled during the data capturing process. The simulation has as output rendered images of household activities and the corresponding forward and backward optical flow. To verify the data for training volumetric correspondence networks for optical flow estimation we train different subsets of the data and test on OmniFlow with and without Test-Time-Augmentation. As a result we have generated 23,653 image pairs and corresponding forward and backward optical flow.

### 29.LAI Estimation of Cucumber Crop Based on Improved Fully Convolutional Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07955.pdf)
>  LAI (Leaf Area Index) is of great importance for crop yield estimation in agronomy. It is directly related to plant growth status, net assimilation rate, plant photosynthesis, and carbon dioxide in the environment. How to measure LAI accurately and efficiently is the key to the crop yield estimation problem. Manual measurement consumes a lot of human resources and material resources. Remote sensing technology is not suitable for near-Earth LAI measurement. Besides, methods based on traditional digital image processing are greatly affected by environmental noise and image exposure. Nowadays, deep learning is widely used in many fields. The improved FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) is proposed in our study for LAI measure task. Eighty-two cucumber images collected from our greenhouse are labeled to fine-tuning the pre-trained model. The result shows that the improved FCN model performs well on our dataset. Our method's mean IoU can reach 0.908, which is 11% better than conventional methods and 4.7% better than the basic FCN model.      
### 30.Towards Human-Understandable Visual Explanations:Imperceptible High-frequency Cues Can Better Be Removed  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07954.pdf)
>  Explainable AI (XAI) methods focus on explaining what a neural network has learned - in other words, identifying the features that are the most influential to the prediction. In this paper, we call them "distinguishing features". However, whether a human can make sense of the generated explanation also depends on the perceptibility of these features to humans. To make sure an explanation is human-understandable, we argue that the capabilities of humans, constrained by the Human Visual System (HVS) and psychophysics, need to be taken into account. We propose the {\em human perceptibility principle for XAI}, stating that, to generate human-understandable explanations, neural networks should be steered towards focusing on human-understandable cues during training. We conduct a case study regarding the classification of real vs. fake face images, where many of the distinguishing features picked up by standard neural networks turn out not to be perceptible to humans. By applying the proposed principle, a neural network with human-understandable explanations is trained which, in a user study, is shown to better align with human intuition. This is likely to make the AI more trustworthy and opens the door to humans learning from machines. In the case study, we specifically investigate and analyze the behaviour of the human-imperceptible high spatial frequency features in neural networks and XAI methods.      
### 31.VGNMN: Video-grounded Neural Module Network to Video-Grounded Language Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07921.pdf)
>  Neural module networks (NMN) have achieved success in image-grounded tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) on synthetic images. However, very limited work on NMN has been studied in the video-grounded language tasks. These tasks extend the complexity of traditional visual tasks with the additional visual temporal variance. Motivated by recent NMN approaches on image-grounded tasks, we introduce Video-grounded Neural Module Network (VGNMN) to model the information retrieval process in video-grounded language tasks as a pipeline of neural modules. VGNMN first decomposes all language components to explicitly resolve any entity references and detect corresponding action-based inputs from the question. The detected entities and actions are used as parameters to instantiate neural module networks and extract visual cues from the video. Our experiments show that VGNMN can achieve promising performance on two video-grounded language tasks: video QA and video-grounded dialogues.      
### 32.Weakly Supervised Object Localization and Detection: A Survey  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07918.pdf)
>  As an emerging and challenging problem in the computer vision community, weakly supervised object localization and detection plays an important role for developing new generation computer vision systems and has received significant attention in the past decade. As methods have been proposed, a comprehensive survey of these topics is of great importance. In this work, we review (1) classic models, (2) approaches with feature representations from off-the-shelf deep networks, (3) approaches solely based on deep learning, and (4) publicly available datasets and standard evaluation metrics that are widely used in this field. We also discuss the key challenges in this field, development history of this field, advantages/disadvantages of the methods in each category, the relationships between methods in different categories, applications of the weakly supervised object localization and detection methods, and potential future directions to further promote the development of this research field.      
### 33.Polynomial Networks in Deep Classifiers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07916.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks have been the driving force behind the success in classification tasks, e.g., object and audio recognition. Impressive results and generalization have been achieved by a variety of recently proposed architectures, the majority of which are seemingly disconnected. In this work, we cast the study of deep classifiers under a unifying framework. In particular, we express state-of-the-art architectures (e.g., residual and non-local networks) in the form of different degree polynomials of the input. Our framework provides insights on the inductive biases of each model and enables natural extensions building upon their polynomial nature. The efficacy of the proposed models is evaluated on standard image and audio classification benchmarks. The expressivity of the proposed models is highlighted both in terms of increased model performance as well as model compression. Lastly, the extensions allowed by this taxonomy showcase benefits in the presence of limited data and long-tailed data distributions. We expect this taxonomy to provide links between existing domain-specific architectures.      
### 34.Identifying Water Stress in Chickpea Plant by Analyzing Progressive Changes in Shoot Images using Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07911.pdf)
>  To meet the needs of a growing world population, we need to increase the global agricultural yields by employing modern, precision, and automated farming methods. In the recent decade, high-throughput plant phenotyping techniques, which combine non-invasive image analysis and machine learning, have been successfully applied to identify and quantify plant health and diseases. However, these image-based machine learning usually do not consider plant stress's progressive or temporal nature. This time-invariant approach also requires images showing severe signs of stress to ensure high confidence detections, thereby reducing this approach's feasibility for early detection and recovery of plants under stress. In order to overcome the problem mentioned above, we propose a temporal analysis of the visual changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it for the specific case of water stress identification in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before flowering, captured over five months. We then develop an LSTM-CNN architecture to learn visual-temporal patterns from this dataset and predict the water stress category with high confidence. To establish a baseline context, we also conduct a comparative analysis of the CNN architecture used in the proposed model with the other CNN techniques used for the time-invariant classification of water stress. The results reveal that our proposed LSTM-CNN model has resulted in the ceiling level classification performance of \textbf{98.52\%} on JG-62 and \textbf{97.78\%} on Pusa-372 and the chickpea plant data. Lastly, we perform an ablation study to determine the LSTM-CNN model's performance on decreasing the amount of temporal session data used for training.      
### 35.Ego-Exo: Transferring Visual Representations from Third-person to First-person Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07905.pdf)
>  We introduce an approach for pre-training egocentric video models using large-scale third-person video datasets. Learning from purely egocentric data is limited by low dataset scale and diversity, while using purely exocentric (third-person) data introduces a large domain mismatch. Our idea is to discover latent signals in third-person video that are predictive of key egocentric-specific properties. Incorporating these signals as knowledge distillation losses during pre-training results in models that benefit from both the scale and diversity of third-person video data, as well as representations that capture salient egocentric properties. Our experiments show that our Ego-Exo framework can be seamlessly integrated into standard video models; it outperforms all baselines when fine-tuned for egocentric activity recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on Charades-Ego and EPIC-Kitchens-100.      
### 36.Histopathology WSI Encoding based on GCNs for Scalable and Efficient Retrieval of Diagnostically Relevant Regions  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07878.pdf)
>  Content-based histopathological image retrieval (CBHIR) has become popular in recent years in the domain of histopathological image analysis. CBHIR systems provide auxiliary diagnosis information for pathologists by searching for and returning regions that are contently similar to the region of interest (ROI) from a pre-established database. While, it is challenging and yet significant in clinical applications to retrieve diagnostically relevant regions from a database that consists of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs) for a query ROI. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for regions retrieval from WSI-database based on hierarchical graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and Hash technique. Compared to the present CBHIR framework, the structural information of WSI is preserved through graph embedding of GCNs, which makes the retrieval framework more sensitive to regions that are similar in tissue distribution. Moreover, benefited from the hierarchical GCN structures, the proposed framework has good scalability for both the size and shape variation of ROIs. It allows the pathologist defining query regions using free curves according to the appearance of tissue. Thirdly, the retrieval is achieved based on Hash technique, which ensures the framework is efficient and thereby adequate for practical large-scale WSI-database. The proposed method was validated on two public datasets for histopathological WSI analysis and compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method achieved mean average precision above 0.857 on the ACDC-LungHP dataset and above 0.864 on the Camelyon16 dataset in the irregular region retrieval tasks, which are superior to the state-of-the-art methods. The average retrieval time from a database within 120 WSIs is 0.802 ms.      
### 37.A De-raining semantic segmentation network for real-time foreground segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07877.pdf)
>  Few researches have been proposed specifically for real-time semantic segmentation in rainy environments. However, the demand in this area is huge and it is challenging for lightweight networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight network which is specially designed for the foreground segmentation in rainy environments, named De-raining Semantic Segmentation Network (DRSNet). By analyzing the characteristics of raindrops, the MultiScaleSE Block is targetedly designed to encode the input image, it uses multi-scale dilated convolutions to increase the receptive field, and SE attention mechanism to learn the weights of each channels. In order to combine semantic information between different encoder and decoder layers, it is proposed to use Asymmetric Skip, that is, the higher semantic layer of encoder employs bilinear interpolation and the output passes through pointwise convolution, then added element-wise to the lower semantic layer of decoder. According to the control experiments, the performances of MultiScaleSE Block and Asymmetric Skip compared with SEResNet18 and Symmetric Skip respectively are improved to a certain degree on the Foreground Accuracy index. The parameters and the floating point of operations (FLOPs) of DRSNet is only 0.54M and 0.20GFLOPs separately. The state-of-the-art results and real-time performances are achieved on both the UESTC all-day Scenery add rain (UAS-add-rain) and the Baidu People Segmentation add rain (BPS-add-rain) benchmarks with the input sizes of 192*128, 384*256 and 768*512. The speed of DRSNet exceeds all the networks within 1GFLOPs, and Foreground Accuracy index is also the best among the similar magnitude networks on both benchmarks.      
### 38.SSPC-Net: Semi-supervised Semantic 3D Point Cloud Segmentation Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07861.pdf)
>  Point cloud semantic segmentation is a crucial task in 3D scene understanding. Existing methods mainly focus on employing a large number of annotated labels for supervised semantic segmentation. Nonetheless, manually labeling such large point clouds for the supervised segmentation task is time-consuming. In order to reduce the number of annotated labels, we propose a semi-supervised semantic point cloud segmentation network, named SSPC-Net, where we train the semantic segmentation network by inferring the labels of unlabeled points from the few annotated 3D points. In our method, we first partition the whole point cloud into superpoints and build superpoint graphs to mine the long-range dependencies in point clouds. Based on the constructed superpoint graph, we then develop a dynamic label propagation method to generate the pseudo labels for the unsupervised superpoints. Particularly, we adopt a superpoint dropout strategy to dynamically select the generated pseudo labels. In order to fully exploit the generated pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints, we furthermore propose a coupled attention mechanism for superpoint feature embedding. Finally, we employ the cross-entropy loss to train the semantic segmentation network with the labels of the supervised superpoints and the pseudo labels of the unsupervised superpoints. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that our semi-supervised segmentation method can achieve better performance than the current semi-supervised segmentation method with fewer annotated 3D points.

### 39.Pareto Self-Supervised Training for Few-Shot Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07841.pdf)
>  While few-shot learning (FSL) aims for rapid generalization to new concepts with little supervision, self-supervised learning (SSL) constructs supervisory signals directly computed from unlabeled data. Exploiting the complementarity of these two manners, few-shot auxiliary learning has recently drawn much attention to deal with few labeled data. Previous works benefit from sharing inductive bias between the main task (FSL) and auxiliary tasks (SSL), where the shared parameters of tasks are optimized by minimizing a linear combination of task losses. However, it is challenging to select a proper weight to balance tasks and reduce task conflict. To handle the problem as a whole, we propose a novel approach named as Pareto self-supervised training (PSST) for FSL. PSST explicitly decomposes the few-shot auxiliary problem into multiple constrained multi-objective subproblems with different trade-off preferences, and here a preference region in which the main task achieves the best performance is identified. Then, an effective preferred Pareto exploration is proposed to find a set of optimal solutions in such a preference region. Extensive experiments on several public benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving state-of-the-art performance.      
### 40.Out-of-Distribution Detection for Dermoscopic Image Classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07819.pdf)
>  Medical image diagnosis can be achieved by deep neural networks, provided there is enough varied training data for each disease class. However, a hitherto unknown disease class not encountered during training will inevitably be misclassified, even if predicted with low probability. This problem is especially important for medical image diagnosis, when an image of a hitherto unknown disease is presented for diagnosis, especially when the images come from the same image domain, such as dermoscopic skin images. <br>Current out-of-distribution detection algorithms act unfairly when the in-distribution classes are imbalanced, by favouring the most numerous disease in the training sets. This could lead to false diagnoses for rare cases which are often medically important. We developed a novel yet simple method to train neural networks, which enables them to classify in-distribution dermoscopic skin disease images and also detect novel diseases from dermoscopic images at test time. We show that our BinaryHeads model not only does not hurt classification balanced accuracy when the data is imbalanced, but also consistently improves the balanced accuracy. We also introduce an important method to investigate the effectiveness of out-of-distribution detection methods based on presence of varying amounts of out-of-distribution data, which may arise in real-world settings.      
### 41.Semisupervised Manifold Alignment of Multimodal Remote Sensing Images  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07803.pdf)
>  We introduce a method for manifold alignment of different modalities (or domains) of remote sensing images. The problem is recurrent when a set of multitemporal, multisource, multisensor and multiangular images is available. In these situations, images should ideally be spatially coregistred, corrected and compensated for differences in the image domains. Such procedures require the interaction of the user, involve tuning of many parameters and heuristics, and are usually applied separately. Changes of sensors and acquisition conditions translate into shifts, twists, warps and foldings of the image distributions (or manifolds). The proposed semisupervised manifold alignment (SS-MA) method aligns the images working directly on their manifolds, and is thus not restricted to images of the same resolutions, either spectral or spatial. SS-MA pulls close together samples of the same class while pushing those of different classes apart. At the same time, it preserves the geometry of each manifold along the transformation. The method builds a linear invertible transformation to a latent space where all images are alike, and reduces to solving a generalized eigenproblem of moderate size. We study the performance of SS-MA in toy examples and in real multiangular, multitemporal, and multisource image classification problems. The method performs well for strong deformations and leads to accurate classification for all domains.      
### 42.Learning User's confidence for active learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07791.pdf)
>  In this paper, we study the applicability of active learning in operative scenarios: more particularly, we consider the well-known contradiction between the active learning heuristics, which rank the pixels according to their uncertainty, and the user's confidence in labeling, which is related to both the homogeneity of the pixel context and user's knowledge of the scene. We propose a filtering scheme based on a classifier that learns the confidence of the user in labeling, thus minimizing the queries where the user would not be able to provide a class for the pixel. The capacity of a model to learn the user's confidence is studied in detail, also showing the effect of resolution is such a learning task. Experiments on two QuickBird images of different resolutions (with and without pansharpening) and considering committees of users prove the efficiency of the filtering scheme proposed, which maximizes the number of useful queries with respect to traditional active learning.      
### 43.Rethinking Text Line Recognition Models  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07787.pdf)
>  In this paper, we study the problem of text line recognition. Unlike most approaches targeting specific domains such as scene-text or handwritten documents, we investigate the general problem of developing a universal architecture that can extract text from any image, regardless of source or input modality. We consider two decoder families (Connectionist Temporal Classification and Transformer) and three encoder modules (Bidirectional LSTMs, Self-Attention, and GRCLs), and conduct extensive experiments to compare their accuracy and performance on widely used public datasets of scene and handwritten text. We find that a combination that so far has received little attention in the literature, namely a Self-Attention encoder coupled with the CTC decoder, when compounded with an external language model and trained on both public and internal data, outperforms all the others in accuracy and computational complexity. Unlike the more common Transformer-based models, this architecture can handle inputs of arbitrary length, a requirement for universal line recognition. Using an internal dataset collected from multiple sources, we also expose the limitations of current public datasets in evaluating the accuracy of line recognizers, as the relatively narrow image width and sequence length distributions do not allow to observe the quality degradation of the Transformer approach when applied to the transcription of long lines.      
### 44.Ridge Regression Neural Network for Pediatric Bone Age Assessment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07785.pdf)
>  Bone age is an important measure for assessing the skeletal and biological maturity of children. Delayed or increased bone age is a serious concern for pediatricians, and needs to be accurately assessed in a bid to determine whether bone maturity is occurring at a rate consistent with chronological age. In this paper, we introduce a unified deep learning framework for bone age assessment using instance segmentation and ridge regression. The proposed approach consists of two integrated stages. In the first stage, we employ an image annotation and segmentation model to annotate and segment the hand from the radiographic image, followed by background removal. In the second stage, we design a regression neural network architecture composed of a pre-trained convolutional neural network for learning salient features from the segmented pediatric hand radiographs and a ridge regression output layer for predicting the bone age. Experimental evaluation on a dataset of hand radiographs demonstrates the competitive performance of our approach in comparison with existing deep learning based methods for bone age assessment.      
### 45.A survey of active learning algorithms for supervised remote sensing image classification  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07784.pdf)
>  Defining an efficient training set is one of the most delicate phases for the success of remote sensing image classification routines. The complexity of the problem, the limited temporal and financial resources, as well as the high intraclass variance can make an algorithm fail if it is trained with a suboptimal dataset. Active learning aims at building efficient training sets by iteratively improving the model performance through sampling. A user-defined heuristic ranks the unlabeled pixels according to a function of the uncertainty of their class membership and then the user is asked to provide labels for the most uncertain pixels. This paper reviews and tests the main families of active learning algorithms: committee, large margin and posterior probability-based. For each of them, the most recent advances in the remote sensing community are discussed and some heuristics are detailed and tested. Several challenging remote sensing scenarios are considered, including very high spatial resolution and hyperspectral image classification. Finally, guidelines for choosing the good architecture are provided for new and/or unexperienced user.      
### 46.Recent Advances in Domain Adaptation for the Classification of Remote Sensing Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07778.pdf)
>  The success of supervised classification of remotely sensed images acquired over large geographical areas or at short time intervals strongly depends on the representativity of the samples used to train the classification algorithm and to define the model. When training samples are collected from an image (or a spatial region) different from the one used for mapping, spectral shifts between the two distributions are likely to make the model fail. Such shifts are generally due to differences in acquisition and atmospheric conditions or to changes in the nature of the object observed. In order to design classification methods that are robust to data-set shifts, recent remote sensing literature has considered solutions based on domain adaptation (DA) approaches. Inspired by machine learning literature, several DA methods have been proposed to solve specific problems in remote sensing data classification. This paper provides a critical review of the recent advances in DA for remote sensing and presents an overview of methods divided into four categories: i) invariant feature selection; ii) representation matching; iii) adaptation of classifiers and iv) selective sampling. We provide an overview of recent methodologies, as well as examples of application of the considered techniques to real remote sensing images characterized by very high spatial and spectral resolution. Finally, we propose guidelines to the selection of the method to use in real application scenarios.      
### 47.AsymmNet: Towards ultralight convolution neural networks using asymmetrical bottlenecks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07770.pdf)
>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved astonishing results in a large variety of applications. However, using these models on mobile or embedded devices is difficult due to the limited memory and computation resources. Recently, the inverted residual block becomes the dominating solution for the architecture design of compact CNNs. In this work, we comprehensively investigated the existing design concepts, rethink the functional characteristics of two pointwise convolutions in the inverted residuals. We propose a novel design, called asymmetrical bottlenecks. Precisely, we adjust the first pointwise convolution dimension, enrich the information flow by feature reuse, and migrate saved computations to the second pointwise convolution. By doing so we can further improve the accuracy without increasing the computation overhead. The asymmetrical bottlenecks can be adopted as a drop-in replacement for the existing CNN blocks. We can thus create AsymmNet by easily stack those blocks according to proper depth and width conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed block design is more beneficial than the original inverted residual bottlenecks for mobile networks, especially useful for those ultralight CNNs within the regime of &lt;220M MAdds.

### 48.Exploring Visual Engagement Signals for Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07767.pdf)
>  Visual engagement in social media platforms comprises interactions with photo posts including comments, shares, and likes. In this paper, we leverage such visual engagement clues as supervisory signals for representation learning. However, learning from engagement signals is non-trivial as it is not clear how to bridge the gap between low-level visual information and high-level social interactions. We present VisE, a weakly supervised learning approach, which maps social images to pseudo labels derived by clustered engagement signals. We then study how models trained in this way benefit subjective downstream computer vision tasks such as emotion recognition or political bias detection. Through extensive studies, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of VisE across a diverse set of classification tasks beyond the scope of conventional recognition.      
### 49.Meta Faster R-CNN: Towards Accurate Few-Shot Object Detection with Attentive Feature Alignment  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07719.pdf)
>  Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects using only few examples. It's critically needed for many practical applications but so far remains challenging. We propose a meta-learning based few-shot object detection method by transferring meta-knowledge learned from data-abundant base classes to data-scarce novel classes. Our method incorporates a coarse-to-fine approach into the proposal based object detection framework and integrates prototype based classifiers into both the proposal generation and classification stages. To improve proposal generation for few-shot novel classes, we propose to learn a lightweight matching network to measure the similarity between each spatial position in the query image feature map and spatially-pooled class features, instead of the traditional object/nonobject classifier, thus generating category-specific proposals and improving proposal recall for novel classes. To address the spatial misalignment between generated proposals and few-shot class examples, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method, thus improving the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we jointly learn a Faster R-CNN detection head for base classes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple FSOD benchmarks show our proposed approach achieves state of the art results under (incremental) few-shot learning settings.      
### 50.Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07713.pdf)
>  Representation learning has significantly been developed with the advance of contrastive learning methods. Most of those methods have benefited from various data augmentations that are carefully designated to maintain their identities so that the images transformed from the same instance can still be retrieved. However, those carefully designed transformations limited us to further explore the novel patterns exposed by other transformations. Meanwhile, as found in our experiments, the strong augmentations distorted the images' structures, resulting in difficult retrieval. Thus, we propose a general framework called Contrastive Learning with Stronger Augmentations~(CLSA) to complement current contrastive learning approaches. Here, the distribution divergence between the weakly and strongly augmented images over the representation bank is adopted to supervise the retrieval of strongly augmented queries from a pool of instances. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset and downstream datasets showed the information from the strongly augmented images can significantly boost the performance. For example, CLSA achieves top-1 accuracy of 76.2% on ImageNet with a standard ResNet-50 architecture with a single-layer classifier fine-tuned, which is almost the same level as 76.5% of supervised results. The code and pre-trained models are available in <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/maple-research-lab/CLSA" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 51.Dual Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07689.pdf)
>  Unsupervised image-to-image translation tasks aim to find a mapping between a source domain X and a target domain Y from unpaired training data. Contrastive learning for Unpaired image-to-image Translation (CUT) yields state-of-the-art results in modeling unsupervised image-to-image translation by maximizing mutual information between input and output patches using only one encoder for both domains. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on contrastive learning and a dual learning setting (exploiting two encoders) to infer an efficient mapping between unpaired data. Additionally, while CUT suffers from mode collapse, a variant of our method efficiently addresses this issue. We further demonstrate the advantage of our approach through extensive ablation studies demonstrating superior performance comparing to recent approaches in multiple challenging image translation tasks. Lastly, we demonstrate that the gap between unsupervised methods and supervised methods can be efficiently closed.      
### 52."BNN - BN = ?": Training Binary Neural Networks without Batch Normalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08215.pdf)
>  Batch normalization (BN) is a key facilitator and considered essential for state-of-the-art binary neural networks (BNN). However, the BN layer is costly to calculate and is typically implemented with non-binary parameters, leaving a hurdle for the efficient implementation of BNN training. It also introduces undesirable dependence between samples within each batch. Inspired by the latest advance on Batch Normalization Free (BN-Free) training, we extend their framework to training BNNs, and for the first time demonstrate that BNs can be completed removed from BNN training and inference regimes. By plugging in and customizing techniques including adaptive gradient clipping, scale weight standardization, and specialized bottleneck block, a BN-free BNN is capable of maintaining competitive accuracy compared to its BN-based counterpart. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal across diverse BNN backbones and datasets. For example, after removing BNs from the state-of-the-art ReActNets, it can still be trained with our proposed methodology to achieve 92.08%, 68.34%, and 68.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet respectively, with marginal performance drop (0.23%~0.44% on CIFAR and 1.40% on ImageNet).

### 53.Uncertainty Surrogates for Deep Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08147.pdf)
>  In this paper we introduce a novel way of estimating prediction uncertainty in deep networks through the use of uncertainty surrogates. These surrogates are features of the penultimate layer of a deep network that are forced to match predefined patterns. The patterns themselves can be, among other possibilities, a known visual symbol. We show how our approach can be used for estimating uncertainty in prediction and out-of-distribution detection. Additionally, the surrogates allow for interpretability of the ability of the deep network to learn and at the same time lend robustness against adversarial attacks. Despite its simplicity, our approach is superior to the state-of-the-art approaches on standard metrics as well as computational efficiency and ease of implementation. A wide range of experiments are performed on standard datasets to prove the efficacy of our approach.      
### 54.Automatic quality control of brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance images for a clinical data warehouse  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08131.pdf)
>  Many studies on machine learning (ML) for computer-aided diagnosis have so far been mostly restricted to high-quality research data. Clinical data warehouses, gathering routine examinations from hospitals, offer great promises for training and validation of ML models in a realistic setting. However, the use of such clinical data warehouses requires quality control (QC) tools. Visual QC by experts is time-consuming and does not scale to large datasets. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic QC of 3D T1-weighted brain MRI for a large heterogeneous clinical data warehouse. To that purpose, we used the data warehouse of the hospitals of the Greater Paris area (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris [AP-HP]). Specifically, the objectives were: 1) to identify images which are not proper T1-weighted brain MRIs; 2) to identify acquisitions for which gadolinium was injected; 3) to rate the overall image quality. We used 5000 images for training and validation and a separate set of 500 images for testing. In order to train/validate the CNN, the data were annotated by two trained raters according to a visual QC protocol that we specifically designed for application in the setting of a data warehouse. For objectives 1 and 2, our approach achieved excellent accuracy (balanced accuracy and F1-score \textgreater 90\%), similar to the human raters. For objective 3, the performance was good but substantially lower than that of human raters. Nevertheless, the automatic approach accurately identified (balanced accuracy and F1-score \textgreater 80\%) low quality images, which would typically need to be excluded. Overall, our approach shall be useful for exploiting hospital data warehouses in medical image computing.      
### 55.Orthogonal Features Based EEG Signals Denoising Using Fractional and Compressed One-Dimensional CNN AutoEncoder  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08120.pdf)
>  This paper presents a fractional one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder for denoising the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals which often get contaminated with noise during the recording process, mostly due to muscle artifacts (MA), introduced by the movement of muscles. The existing EEG denoising methods make use of decomposition, thresholding and filtering techniques. In the proposed approach, EEG signals are first transformed to orthogonal domain using Tchebichef moments before feeding to the proposed architecture. A new hyper-parameter ($\alpha$) is introduced which refers to the fractional order with respect to which gradients are calculated during back-propagation. It is observed that by tuning $\alpha$, the quality of the restored signal improves significantly. Motivated by the high usage of portable low energy devices which make use of compressed deep learning architectures, the trainable parameters of the proposed architecture are compressed using randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) algorithm. The experiments are performed on the standard EEG datasets, namely, Mendeley and Bonn. The study shows that the proposed fractional and compressed architecture performs better than existing state-of-the-art signal denoising methods.

>  We describe in this short note a technique to convert an implicit surface into a Signed Distance Function (SDF) while exactly preserving the zero level-set of the implicit. The proposed approach relies on embedding the input implicit in the final layer of a neural network, which is trained to minimize a loss function characterizing the SDF.

### 58.Attention! Stay Focus!  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07925.pdf)
>  We develop a deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) to deal with the blurry artifacts caused by the defocus of the camera using dual-pixel images. Specifically, we develop a double attention network which consists of attentional encoders, triple locals and global local modules to effectively extract useful information from each image in the dual-pixels and select the useful information from each image and synthesize the final output image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deblurring algorithm in terms of both qualitative and quantitative aspects by evaluating on the test set in the NTIRE 2021 Defocus Deblurring using Dual-pixel Images Challenge.

### 59.Deep Stable Learning for Out-Of-Distribution Generalization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07876.pdf)
>  Approaches based on deep neural networks have achieved striking performance when testing data and training data share similar distribution, but can significantly fail otherwise. Therefore, eliminating the impact of distribution shifts between training and testing data is crucial for building performance-promising deep models. Conventional methods assume either the known heterogeneity of training data (e.g. domain labels) or the approximately equal capacities of different domains. In this paper, we consider a more challenging case where neither of the above assumptions holds. We propose to address this problem by removing the dependencies between features via learning weights for training samples, which helps deep models get rid of spurious correlations and, in turn, concentrate more on the true connection between discriminative features and labels. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on multiple distribution generalization benchmarks compared with state-of-the-art counterparts. Through extensive experiments on distribution generalization benchmarks including PACS, VLCS, MNIST-M, and NICO, we show the effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art counterparts.      
### 60.Shoulder Implant X-Ray Manufacturer Classification: Exploring with Vision Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07667.pdf)
>  Shoulder replacement surgery, also called total shoulder replacement, is a common and complex surgery in Orthopedics discipline. It involves replacing a dead shoulder joint with an artificial implant. In the market, there are many artificial implant manufacturers and each of them may produce different implants with different structures compares to other providers. The problem arises in the following situation: a patient has some problems with the shoulder implant accessory and the manufacturer of that implant maybe unknown to either the patient or the doctor, therefore, correctly identification of the manufacturer is the key prior to the treatment. In this paper, we will demonstrate different methods for classifying the manufacturer of a shoulder implant. We will use Vision Transformer approach to this task for the first time ever
