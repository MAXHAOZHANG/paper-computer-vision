### 1.End-to-end Temporal Action Detection with Transformer  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10271.pdf)
>  Temporal action detection (TAD) aims to determine the semantic label and the boundaries of every action instance in an untrimmed video. It is a fundamental task in video understanding and significant progress has been made in TAD. Previous methods involve multiple stages or networks and hand-designed rules or operations, which fall short in efficiency and flexibility. Here, we construct an end-to-end framework for TAD upon Transformer, termed \textit{TadTR}, which simultaneously predicts all action instances as a set of labels and temporal locations in parallel. TadTR is able to adaptively extract temporal context information needed for making action predictions, by selectively attending to a number of snippets in a video. It greatly simplifies the pipeline of TAD and runs much faster than previous detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on HACS Segments and THUMOS14 and competitive performance on ActivityNet-1.3. Our code will be made available at \url{<a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/xlliu7/TadTR" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>}.      
### 2.How to train your ViT? Data, Augmentation, and Regularization in Vision Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10270.pdf)
>  Vision Transformers (ViT) have been shown to attain highly competitive performance for a wide range of vision applications, such as image classification, object detection and semantic image segmentation. In comparison to convolutional neural networks, the Vision Transformer's weaker inductive bias is generally found to cause an increased reliance on model regularization or data augmentation (``AugReg'' for short) when training on smaller training datasets. We conduct a systematic empirical study in order to better understand the interplay between the amount of training data, AugReg, model size and compute budget. As one result of this study we find that the combination of increased compute and AugReg can yield models with the same performance as models trained on an order of magnitude more training data: we train ViT models of various sizes on the public ImageNet-21k dataset which either match or outperform their counterparts trained on the larger, but not publicly available JFT-300M dataset.      
### 3.Bridging the Gap Between Object Detection and User Intent via Query-Modulation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10258.pdf)
>  When interacting with objects through cameras, or pictures, users often have a specific intent. For example, they may want to perform a visual search. However, most object detection models ignore the user intent, relying on image pixels as their only input. This often leads to incorrect results, such as lack of a high-confidence detection on the object of interest, or detection with a wrong class label. In this paper we investigate techniques to modulate standard object detectors to explicitly account for the user intent, expressed as an embedding of a simple query. Compared to standard object detectors, query-modulated detectors show superior performance at detecting objects for a given label of interest. Thanks to large-scale training data synthesized from standard object detection annotations, query-modulated detectors can also outperform specialized referring expression recognition systems. Furthermore, they can be simultaneously trained to solve for both query-modulated detection and standard object detection.      
### 4.VSAC: Efficient and Accurate Estimator for H and F  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10240.pdf)
>  We present VSAC, a RANSAC-type robust estimator with a number of novelties. It benefits from the introduction of the concept of independent inliers that improves significantly the efficacy of the dominant plane handling and, also, allows near error-free rejection of incorrect models, without false positives. The local optimization process and its application is improved so that it is run on average only once. Further technical improvements include adaptive sequential hypothesis verification and efficient model estimation via Gaussian elimination. Experiments on four standard datasets show that VSAC is significantly faster than all its predecessors and runs on average in 1-2 ms, on a CPU. It is two orders of magnitude faster and yet as precise as MAGSAC++, the currently most accurate estimator of two-view geometry. In the repeated runs on EVD, HPatches, PhotoTourism, and Kusvod2 datasets, it never failed.      
### 5.A Coarse-to-Fine Instance Segmentation Network with Learning Boundary Representation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10213.pdf)
>  Boundary-based instance segmentation has drawn much attention since of its attractive efficiency. However, existing methods suffer from the difficulty in long-distance regression. In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine module to address the problem. Approximate boundary points are generated at the coarse stage and then features of these points are sampled and fed to a refined regressor for fine prediction. It is end-to-end trainable since differential sampling operation is well supported in the module. Furthermore, we design a holistic boundary-aware branch and introduce instance-agnostic supervision to assist regression. Equipped with ResNet-101, our approach achieves 31.7\% mask AP on COCO dataset with single-scale training and testing, outperforming the baseline 1.3\% mask AP with less than 1\% additional parameters and GFLOPs. Experiments also show that our proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to existing boundary-based methods with a lightweight design and a simple pipeline.      
### 6.A Dynamic Spatial-temporal Attention Network for Early Anticipation of Traffic Accidents  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10197.pdf)
>  Recently, autonomous vehicles and those equipped with an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) are emerging. They share the road with regular ones operated by human drivers entirely. To ensure guaranteed safety for passengers and other road users, it becomes essential for autonomous vehicles and ADAS to anticipate traffic accidents from natural driving scenes. The dynamic spatial-temporal interaction of the traffic agents is complex, and visual cues for predicting a future accident are embedded deeply in dashcam video data. Therefore, early anticipation of traffic accidents remains a challenge. To this end, the paper presents a dynamic spatial-temporal attention (DSTA) network for early anticipation of traffic accidents from dashcam videos. The proposed DSTA-network learns to select discriminative temporal segments of a video sequence with a module named Dynamic Temporal Attention (DTA). It also learns to focus on the informative spatial regions of frames with another module named Dynamic Spatial Attention (DSA). The spatial-temporal relational features of accidents, along with scene appearance features, are learned jointly with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network. The experimental evaluation of the DSTA-network on two benchmark datasets confirms that it has exceeded the state-of-the-art performance. A thorough ablation study evaluates the contributions of individual components of the DSTA-network, revealing how the network achieves such performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new strategy that fuses the prediction scores from two complementary models and verifies its effectiveness in further boosting the performance of early accident anticipation.      
### 7.Toward Fault Detection in Industrial Welding Processes with Deep Learning and Data Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10160.pdf)
>  With the rise of deep learning models in the field of computer vision, new possibilities for their application in industrial processes proves to return great benefits. Nevertheless, the actual fit of machine learning for highly standardised industrial processes is still under debate. This paper addresses the challenges on the industrial realization of the AI tools, considering the use case of Laser Beam Welding quality control as an example. We use object detection algorithms from the TensorFlow object detection API and adapt them to our use case using transfer learning. The baseline models we develop are used as benchmarks and evaluated and compared to models that undergo dataset scaling and hyperparameter tuning. We find that moderate scaling of the dataset via image augmentation leads to improvements in intersection over union (IoU) and recall, whereas high levels of augmentation and scaling may lead to deterioration of results. Finally, we put our results into perspective of the underlying use case and evaluate their fit.      
### 8.All You Can Embed: Natural Language based Vehicle Retrieval with Spatio-Temporal Transformers  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10153.pdf)
>  Combining Natural Language with Vision represents a unique and interesting challenge in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. The AI City Challenge Track 5 for Natural Language-Based Vehicle Retrieval focuses on the problem of combining visual and textual information, applied to a smart-city use case. In this paper, we present All You Can Embed (AYCE), a modular solution to correlate single-vehicle tracking sequences with natural language. The main building blocks of the proposed architecture are (i) BERT to provide an embedding of the textual descriptions, (ii) a convolutional backbone along with a Transformer model to embed the visual information. For the training of the retrieval model, a variation of the Triplet Margin Loss is proposed to learn a distance measure between the visual and language embeddings. The code is publicly available at <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/cscribano/AYCE_2021" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 9.Self-supervised Video Representation Learning with Cross-Stream Prototypical Contrasting  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10137.pdf)
>  Instance-level contrastive learning techniques, which rely on data augmentation and a contrastive loss function, have found great success in the domain of visual representation learning. They are not suitable for exploiting the rich dynamical structure of video however, as operations are done on many augmented instances. In this paper we propose "Video Cross-Stream Prototypical Contrasting", a novel method which predicts consistent prototype assignments from both RGB and optical flow views, operating on sets of samples. Specifically, we alternate the optimization process; while optimizing one of the streams, all views are mapped to one set of stream prototype vectors. Each of the assignments is predicted with all views except the one matching the prediction, pushing representations closer to their assigned prototypes. As a result, more efficient video embeddings with ingrained motion information are learned, without the explicit need for optical flow computation during inference. We obtain state-of-the-art results on nearest neighbour video retrieval and action recognition, outperforming previous best by +3.2% on UCF101 using the S3D backbone (90.5% Top-1 acc), and by +7.2% on UCF101 and +15.1% on HMDB51 using the R(2+1)D backbone.      
### 10.Virtual Temporal Samples for Recurrent Neural Networks: applied to semantic segmentation in agriculture  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10118.pdf)
>  This paper explores the potential for performing temporal semantic segmentation in the context of agricultural robotics without temporally labelled data. We achieve this by proposing to generate virtual temporal samples from labelled still images. This allows us, with no extra annotation effort, to generate virtually labelled temporal sequences. Normally, to train a recurrent neural network (RNN), labelled samples from a video (temporal) sequence are required which is laborious and has stymied work in this direction. By generating virtual temporal samples, we demonstrate that it is possible to train a lightweight RNN to perform semantic segmentation on two challenging agricultural datasets. Our results show that by training a temporal semantic segmenter using virtual samples we can increase the performance by an absolute amount of 4.6 and 4.9 on sweet pepper and sugar beet datasets, respectively. This indicates that our virtual data augmentation technique is able to accurately classify agricultural images temporally without the use of complicated synthetic data generation techniques nor with the overhead of labelling large amounts of temporal sequences.      
### 11.Towards Distraction-Robust Active Visual Tracking  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10110.pdf)
>  In active visual tracking, it is notoriously difficult when distracting objects appear, as distractors often mislead the tracker by occluding the target or bringing a confusing appearance. To address this issue, we propose a mixed cooperative-competitive multi-agent game, where a target and multiple distractors form a collaborative team to play against a tracker and make it fail to follow. Through learning in our game, diverse distracting behaviors of the distractors naturally emerge, thereby exposing the tracker's weakness, which helps enhance the distraction-robustness of the tracker. For effective learning, we then present a bunch of practical methods, including a reward function for distractors, a cross-modal teacher-student learning strategy, and a recurrent attention mechanism for the tracker. The experimental results show that our tracker performs desired distraction-robust active visual tracking and can be well generalized to unseen environments. We also show that the multi-agent game can be used to adversarially test the robustness of trackers.      
### 12.hSMAL: Detailed Horse Shape and Pose Reconstruction for Motion Pattern Recognition  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10102.pdf)
>  In this paper we present our preliminary work on model-based behavioral analysis of horse motion. Our approach is based on the SMAL model, a 3D articulated statistical model of animal shape. We define a novel SMAL model for horses based on a new template, skeleton and shape space learned from $37$ horse toys. We test the accuracy of our hSMAL model in reconstructing a horse from 3D mocap data and images. We apply the hSMAL model to the problem of lameness detection from video, where we fit the model to images to recover 3D pose and train an ST-GCN network on pose data. A comparison with the same network trained on mocap points illustrates the benefit of our approach.      
### 13.Discerning Generic Event Boundaries in Long-Form Wild Videos  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10090.pdf)
>  Detecting generic, taxonomy-free event boundaries invideos represents a major stride forward towards holisticvideo understanding. In this paper we present a technique forgeneric event boundary detection based on a two stream in-flated 3D convolutions architecture, which can learn spatio-temporal features from videos. Our work is inspired from theGeneric Event Boundary Detection Challenge (part of CVPR2021 Long Form Video Understanding- LOVEU Workshop).Throughout the paper we provide an in-depth analysis ofthe experiments performed along with an interpretation ofthe results obtained.      
### 14.Combined Person Classification with Airborne Optical Sectioning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10077.pdf)
>  Fully autonomous drones have been demonstrated to find lost or injured persons under strongly occluding forest canopy. Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS), a novel synthetic aperture imaging technique, together with deep-learning-based classification enables high detection rates under realistic search-and-rescue conditions. We demonstrate that false detections can be significantly suppressed and true detections boosted by combining classifications from multiple AOS rather than single integral images. This improves classification rates especially in the presence of occlusion. To make this possible, we modified the AOS imaging process to support large overlaps between subsequent integrals, enabling real-time and on-board scanning and processing of groundspeeds up to 10 m/s.      
### 15.Residual Contrastive Learning for Joint Demosaicking and Denoising  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10070.pdf)
>  The breakthrough of contrastive learning (CL) has fueled the recent success of self-supervised learning (SSL) in high-level vision tasks on RGB images. However, CL is still ill-defined for low-level vision tasks, such as joint demosaicking and denoising (JDD), in the RAW domain. To bridge this methodological gap, we present a novel CL approach on RAW images, residual contrastive learning (RCL), which aims to learn meaningful representations for JDD. Our work is built on the assumption that noise contained in each RAW image is signal-dependent, thus two crops from the same RAW image should have more similar noise distribution than two crops from different RAW images. We use residuals as a discriminative feature and the earth mover's distance to measure the distribution divergence for the contrastive loss. To evaluate the proposed CL strategy, we simulate a series of unsupervised JDD experiments with large-scale data corrupted by synthetic signal-dependent noise, where we set a new benchmark for unsupervised JDD tasks with unknown (random) noise variance. Our empirical study not only validates that CL can be applied on distributions (c.f. features), but also exposes the lack of robustness of previous non-ML and SSL JDD methods when the statistics of the noise are unknown, thus providing some further insight into signal-dependent noise problems.      
### 16.Contrastive Learning of Generalized Game Representations  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10060.pdf)
>  Representing games through their pixels offers a promising approach for building general-purpose and versatile game models. While games are not merely images, neural network models trained on game pixels often capture differences of the visual style of the image rather than the content of the game. As a result, such models cannot generalize well even within similar games of the same genre. In this paper we build on recent advances in contrastive learning and showcase its benefits for representation learning in games. Learning to contrast images of games not only classifies games in a more efficient manner; it also yields models that separate games in a more meaningful fashion by ignoring the visual style and focusing, instead, on their content. Our results in a large dataset of sports video games containing 100k images across 175 games and 10 game genres suggest that contrastive learning is better suited for learning generalized game representations compared to conventional supervised learning. The findings of this study bring us closer to universal visual encoders for games that can be reused across previously unseen games without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.      
### 17.Light Pollution Reduction in Nighttime Photography  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10046.pdf)
>  Nighttime photographers are often troubled by light pollution of unwanted artificial lights. Artificial lights, after scattered by aerosols in the atmosphere, can inundate the starlight and degrade the quality of nighttime images, by reducing contrast and dynamic range and causing hazes. In this paper we develop a physically-based light pollution reduction (LPR) algorithm that can substantially alleviate the aforementioned degradations of perceptual quality and restore the pristine state of night sky. The key to the success of the proposed LPR algorithm is an inverse method to estimate the spatial radiance distribution and spectral signature of ground artificial lights. Extensive experiments are carried out to evaluate the efficacy and limitations of the LPR algorithm.      
### 18.Training or Architecture? How to Incorporate Invariance in Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10044.pdf)
>  Many applications require the robustness, or ideally the invariance, of a neural network to certain transformations of input data. Most commonly, this requirement is addressed by either augmenting the training data, using adversarial training, or defining network architectures that include the desired invariance automatically. Unfortunately, the latter often relies on the ability to enlist all possible transformations, which make such approaches largely infeasible for infinite sets of transformations, such as arbitrary rotations or scaling. In this work, we propose a method for provably invariant network architectures with respect to group actions by choosing one element from a (possibly continuous) orbit based on a fixed criterion. In a nutshell, we intend to 'undo' any possible transformation before feeding the data into the actual network. We analyze properties of such approaches, extend them to equivariant networks, and demonstrate their advantages in terms of robustness as well as computational efficiency in several numerical examples. In particular, we investigate the robustness with respect to rotations of images (which can possibly hold up to discretization artifacts only) as well as the provable rotational and scaling invariance of 3D point cloud classification.      
### 19.Learning and Meshing from Deep Implicit Surface Networks Using an Efficient Implementation of Analytic Marching  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10031.pdf)
>  Reconstruction of object or scene surfaces has tremendous applications in computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics. In this paper, we study a fundamental problem in this context about recovering a surface mesh from an implicit field function whose zero-level set captures the underlying surface. To achieve the goal, existing methods rely on traditional meshing algorithms; while promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the implicit surface networks, due to the use of discrete space sampling in marching cubes. Given that an MLP with activations of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) partitions its input space into a number of linear regions, we are motivated to connect this local linearity with a same property owned by the desired result of polygon mesh. More specifically, we identify from the linear regions, partitioned by an MLP based implicit function, the analytic cells and analytic faces that are associated with the function's zero-level isosurface. We prove that under mild conditions, the identified analytic faces are guaranteed to connect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface. Based on the theorem, we propose an algorithm of analytic marching, which marches among analytic cells to exactly recover the mesh captured by an implicit surface network. We also show that our theory and algorithm are equally applicable to advanced MLPs with shortcut connections and max pooling. Given the parallel nature of analytic marching, we contribute AnalyticMesh, a software package that supports efficient meshing of implicit surface networks via CUDA parallel computing, and mesh simplification for efficient downstream processing. We apply our method to different settings of generative shape modeling using implicit surface networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate our advantages over existing methods in terms of both meshing accuracy and efficiency.      
### 20.EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Challenge for Action Recognition 2021: Team M3EM Technical Report  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10026.pdf)
>  In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the 2021 EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Challenge for Action Recognition. Leveraging multiple modalities has been proved to benefit the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) task. In this work, we present Multi-Modal Mutual Enhancement Module (M3EM), a deep module for jointly considering information from multiple modalities to find the most transferable representations across domains. We achieve this by implementing two sub-modules for enhancing each modality using the context of other modalities. The first sub-module exchanges information across modalities through the semantic space, while the second sub-module finds the most transferable spatial region based on the consensus of all modalities.      
### 21.Shape Prior Non-Uniform Sampling Guided Real-time Stereo 3D Object Detection  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10013.pdf)
>  Pseudo-LiDAR based 3D object detectors have gained popularity due to their high accuracy. However, these methods need dense depth supervision and suffer from inferior speed. To solve these two issues, a recently introduced RTS3D builds an efficient 4D Feature-Consistency Embedding (FCE) space for the intermediate representation of object without depth supervision. FCE space splits the entire object region into 3D uniform grid latent space for feature sampling point generation, which ignores the importance of different object regions. However, we argue that, compared with the inner region, the outer region plays a more important role for accurate 3D detection. To encode more information from the outer region, we propose a shape prior non-uniform sampling strategy that performs dense sampling in outer region and sparse sampling in inner region. As a result, more points are sampled from the outer region and more useful features are extracted for 3D detection. Further, to enhance the feature discrimination of each sampling point, we propose a high-level semantic enhanced FCE module to exploit more contextual information and suppress noise better. Experiments on the KITTI dataset are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the baseline RTS3D, our proposed method has 2.57% improvement on AP3d almost without extra network parameters. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without extra supervision at a real-time speed.      
### 22.Equivariance-bridged SO(2)-Invariant Representation Learning using Graph Convolutional Network  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09996.pdf)
>  Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to be robust against rotation has mostly been done with data augmentation. In this paper, another progressive vision of research direction is highlighted to encourage less dependence on data augmentation by achieving structural rotational invariance of a network. The deep equivariance-bridged SO(2) invariant network is proposed to echo such vision. First, Self-Weighted Nearest Neighbors Graph Convolutional Network (SWN-GCN) is proposed to implement Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) on the graph representation of an image to acquire rotationally equivariant representation, as GCN is more suitable for constructing deeper network than spectral graph convolution-based approaches. Then, invariant representation is eventually obtained with Global Average Pooling (GAP), a permutation-invariant operation suitable for aggregating high-dimensional representations, over the equivariant set of vertices retrieved from SWN-GCN. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art image classification performance on rotated MNIST and CIFAR-10 images, where the models are trained with a non-augmented dataset only. Quantitative validations over invariance of the representations also demonstrate strong invariance of deep representations of SWN-GCN over rotations.      
### 23.Advanced Hough-based method for on-device document localization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09987.pdf)
>  The demand for on-device document recognition systems increases in conjunction with the emergence of more strict privacy and security requirements. In such systems, there is no data transfer from the end device to a third-party information processing servers. The response time is vital to the user experience of on-device document recognition. Combined with the unavailability of discrete GPUs, powerful CPUs, or a large RAM capacity on consumer-grade end devices such as smartphones, the time limitations put significant constraints on the computational complexity of the applied algorithms for on-device execution. <br>In this work, we consider document location in an image without prior knowledge of the document content or its internal structure. In accordance with the published works, at least 5 systems offer solutions for on-device document location. All these systems use a location method which can be considered Hough-based. The precision of such systems seems to be lower than that of the state-of-the-art solutions which were not designed to account for the limited computational resources. <br>We propose an advanced Hough-based method. In contrast with other approaches, it accounts for the geometric invariants of the central projection model and combines both edge and color features for document boundary detection. The proposed method allowed for the second best result for SmartDoc dataset in terms of precision, surpassed by U-net like neural network. When evaluated on a more challenging MIDV-500 dataset, the proposed algorithm guaranteed the best precision compared to published methods. Our method retained the applicability to on-device computations.      
### 24.Towards interpreting computer vision based on transformation invariant optimization  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09982.pdf)
>  Interpreting how does deep neural networks (DNNs) make predictions is a vital field in artificial intelligence, which hinders wide applications of DNNs. Visualization of learned representations helps we humans understand the vision of DNNs. In this work, visualized images that can activate the neural network to the target classes are generated by back-propagation method. Here, rotation and scaling operations are applied to introduce the transformation invariance in the image generating process, which we find a significant improvement on visualization effect. Finally, we show some cases that such method can help us to gain insight into neural networks.      
### 25.HifiFace: 3D Shape and Semantic Prior Guided High Fidelity Face Swapping  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09965.pdf)
>  In this work, we propose a high fidelity face swapping method, called HifiFace, which can well preserve the face shape of the source face and generate photo-realistic results. Unlike other existing face swapping works that only use face recognition model to keep the identity similarity, we propose 3D shape-aware identity to control the face shape with the geometric supervision from 3DMM and 3D face reconstruction method. Meanwhile, we introduce the Semantic Facial Fusion module to optimize the combination of encoder and decoder features and make adaptive blending, which makes the results more photo-realistic. Extensive experiments on faces in the wild demonstrate that our method can preserve better identity, especially on the face shape, and can generate more photo-realistic results than previous state-of-the-art methods.      
### 26.Multi-Granularity Network with Modal Attention for Dense Affective Understanding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09964.pdf)
>  Video affective understanding, which aims to predict the evoked expressions by the video content, is desired for video creation and recommendation. In the recent EEV challenge, a dense affective understanding task is proposed and requires frame-level affective prediction. In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity network with modal attention (MGN-MA), which employs multi-granularity features for better description of the target frame. Specifically, the multi-granularity features could be divided into frame-level, clips-level and video-level features, which corresponds to visual-salient content, semantic-context and video theme information. Then the modal attention fusion module is designed to fuse the multi-granularity features and emphasize more affection-relevant modals. Finally, the fused feature is fed into a Mixtures Of Experts (MOE) classifier to predict the expressions. Further employing model-ensemble post-processing, the proposed method achieves the correlation score of 0.02292 in the EEV challenge.      
### 27.Novelty Detection via Contrastive Learning with Negative Data Augmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09958.pdf)
>  Novelty detection is the process of determining whether a query example differs from the learned training distribution. Previous methods attempt to learn the representation of the normal samples via generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, they will suffer from instability training, mode dropping, and low discriminative ability. Recently, various pretext tasks (e.g. rotation prediction and clustering) have been proposed for self-supervised learning in novelty detection. However, the learned latent features are still low discriminative. We overcome such problems by introducing a novel decoder-encoder framework. Firstly, a generative network (a.k.a. decoder) learns the representation by mapping the initialized latent vector to an image. In particular, this vector is initialized by considering the entire distribution of training data to avoid the problem of mode-dropping. Secondly, a contrastive network (a.k.a. encoder) aims to ``learn to compare'' through mutual information estimation, which directly helps the generative network to obtain a more discriminative representation by using a negative data augmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our model has significant superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves new state-of-the-art results on some novelty detection benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR10 and DCASE. Moreover, our model is more stable for training in a non-adversarial manner, compared to other adversarial based novelty detection methods.      
### 28.A Framework for Real-time Traffic Trajectory Tracking, Speed Estimation, and Driver Behavior Calibration at Urban Intersections Using Virtual Traffic Lanes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09932.pdf)
>  In a previous study, we presented VT-Lane, a three-step framework for real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and turn movement classification at urban intersections. In this study, we present a case study incorporating the highly accurate trajectories and movement classification obtained via VT-Lane for the purpose of speed estimation and driver behavior calibration for traffic at urban intersections. First, we use a highly instrumented vehicle to verify the estimated speeds obtained from video inference. The results of the speed validation show that our method can estimate the average travel speed of detected vehicles in real-time with an error of 0.19 m/sec, which is equivalent to 2% of the average observed travel speeds in the intersection of the study. Instantaneous speeds (at the resolution of 30 Hz) were found to be estimated with an average error of 0.21 m/sec and 0.86 m/sec respectively for free-flowing and congested traffic conditions. We then use the estimated speeds to calibrate the parameters of a driver behavior model for the vehicles in the area of study. The results show that the calibrated model replicates the driving behavior with an average error of 0.45 m/sec, indicating the high potential for using this framework for automated, large-scale calibration of car-following models from roadside traffic video data, which can lead to substantial improvements in traffic modeling via microscopic simulation.      
### 29.Light Lies: Optical Adversarial Attack  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09908.pdf)
>  A significant amount of work has been done on adversarial attacks that inject imperceptible noise to images to deteriorate the image classification performance of deep models. However, most of the existing studies consider attacks in the digital (pixel) domain where an image acquired by an image sensor with sampling and quantization has been recorded. This paper, for the first time, introduces an optical adversarial attack, which physically alters the light field information arriving at the image sensor so that the classification model yields misclassification. More specifically, we modulate the phase of the light in the Fourier domain using a spatial light modulator placed in the photographic system. The operative parameters of the modulator are obtained by gradient-based optimization to maximize cross-entropy and minimize distortions. We present experiments based on both simulation and a real hardware optical system, from which the feasibility of the proposed optical attack is demonstrated. It is also verified that the proposed attack is completely different from common optical-domain distortions such as spherical aberration, defocus, and astigmatism in terms of both perturbation patterns and classification results.      
### 30.Medical Matting: A New Perspective on Medical Segmentation with Uncertainty  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09887.pdf)
>  In medical image segmentation, it is difficult to mark ambiguous areas accurately with binary masks, especially when dealing with small lesions. Therefore, it is a challenge for radiologists to reach a consensus by using binary masks under the condition of multiple annotations. However, these areas may contain anatomical structures that are conducive to diagnosis. Uncertainty is introduced to study these situations. Nevertheless, the uncertainty is usually measured by the variances between predictions in a multiple trial way. It is not intuitive, and there is no exact correspondence in the image. Inspired by image matting, we introduce matting as a soft segmentation method and a new perspective to deal with and represent uncertain regions into medical scenes, namely medical matting. More specifically, because there is no available medical matting dataset, we first labeled two medical datasets with alpha matte. Secondly, the matting method applied to the natural image is not suitable for the medical scene, so we propose a new architecture to generate binary masks and alpha matte in a row. Thirdly, the uncertainty map is introduced to highlight the ambiguous regions from the binary results and improve the matting performance. Evaluated on these datasets, the proposed model outperformed state-of-the-art matting algorithms by a large margin, and alpha matte is proved to be a more efficient labeling form than a binary mask.      
### 31.Quantized Neural Networks via {-1, +1} Encoding Decomposition and Acceleration  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09886.pdf)
>  The training of deep neural networks (DNNs) always requires intensive resources for both computation and data storage. Thus, DNNs cannot be efficiently applied to mobile phones and embedded devices, which severely limits their applicability in industrial applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel encoding scheme using {-1, +1} to decompose quantized neural networks (QNNs) into multi-branch binary networks, which can be efficiently implemented by bitwise operations (i.e., xnor and bitcount) to achieve model compression, computational acceleration, and resource saving. By using our method, users can achieve different encoding precisions arbitrarily according to their requirements and hardware resources. The proposed mechanism is highly suitable for the use of FPGA and ASIC in terms of data storage and computation, which provides a feasible idea for smart chips. We validate the effectiveness of our method on large-scale image classification (e.g., ImageNet), object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. In particular, our method with low-bit encoding can still achieve almost the same performance as its high-bit counterparts.      
### 32.Smoothed Multi-View Subspace Clustering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09875.pdf)
>  In recent years, multi-view subspace clustering has achieved impressive performance due to the exploitation of complementary imformation across multiple views. However, multi-view data can be very complicated and are not easy to cluster in real-world applications. Most existing methods operate on raw data and may not obtain the optimal solution. In this work, we propose a novel multi-view clustering method named smoothed multi-view subspace clustering (SMVSC) by employing a novel technique, i.e., graph filtering, to obtain a smooth representation for each view, in which similar data points have similar feature values. Specifically, it retains the graph geometric features through applying a low-pass filter. Consequently, it produces a ``clustering-friendly" representation and greatly facilitates the downstream clustering task. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our approach. Analysis shows that graph filtering increases the separability of classes.      
### 33.Towards Clustering-friendly Representations: Subspace Clustering via Graph Filtering  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09874.pdf)
>  Finding a suitable data representation for a specific task has been shown to be crucial in many applications. The success of subspace clustering depends on the assumption that the data can be separated into different subspaces. However, this simple assumption does not always hold since the raw data might not be separable into subspaces. To recover the ``clustering-friendly'' representation and facilitate the subsequent clustering, we propose a graph filtering approach by which a smooth representation is achieved. Specifically, it injects graph similarity into data features by applying a low-pass filter to extract useful data representations for clustering. Extensive experiments on image and document clustering datasets demonstrate that our method improves upon state-of-the-art subspace clustering techniques. Especially, its comparable performance with deep learning methods emphasizes the effectiveness of the simple graph filtering scheme for many real-world applications. An ablation study shows that graph filtering can remove noise, preserve structure in the image, and increase the separability of classes.      
### 34.Analyzing Adversarial Robustness of Deep Neural Networks in Pixel Space: a Semantic Perspective  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09872.pdf)
>  The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which are crafted maliciously by modifying the inputs with imperceptible perturbations to misled the network produce incorrect outputs, reveals the lack of robustness and poses security concerns. Previous works study the adversarial robustness of image classifiers on image level and use all the pixel information in an image indiscriminately, lacking of exploration of regions with different semantic meanings in the pixel space of an image. In this work, we fill this gap and explore the pixel space of the adversarial image by proposing an algorithm to looking for possible perturbations pixel by pixel in different regions of the segmented image. The extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet verify that searching for the modified pixel in only some pixels of an image can successfully launch the one-pixel adversarial attacks without requiring all the pixels of the entire image, and there exist multiple vulnerable points scattered in different regions of an image. We also demonstrate that the adversarial robustness of different regions on the image varies with the amount of semantic information contained.      
### 35.Medical Image Analysis on Left Atrial LGE MRI for Atrial Fibrillation Studies: A Review  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09862.pdf)
>  Late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI) is commonly used to visualize and quantify left atrial (LA) scars. The position and extent of scars provide important information of the pathophysiology and progression of atrial fibrillation (AF). Hence, LA scar segmentation and quantification from LGE MRI can be useful in computer-assisted diagnosis and treatment stratification of AF patients. Since manual delineation can be time-consuming and subject to intra- and inter-expert variability, automating this computing is highly desired, which nevertheless is still challenging and under-researched. <br>This paper aims to provide a systematic review on computing methods for LA cavity, wall, scar and ablation gap segmentation and quantification from LGE MRI, and the related literature for AF studies. Specifically, we first summarize AF-related imaging techniques, particularly LGE MRI. Then, we review the methodologies of the four computing tasks in detail, and summarize the validation strategies applied in each task. Finally, the possible future developments are outlined, with a brief survey on the potential clinical applications of the aforementioned methods. The review shows that the research into this topic is still in early stages. Although several methods have been proposed, especially for LA segmentation, there is still large scope for further algorithmic developments due to performance issues related to the high variability of enhancement appearance and differences in image acquisition.      
### 36.RSG: A Simple but Effective Module for Learning Imbalanced Datasets  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09859.pdf)
>  Imbalanced datasets widely exist in practice and area great challenge for training deep neural models with agood generalization on infrequent classes. In this work, wepropose a new rare-class sample generator (RSG) to solvethis problem. RSG aims to generate some new samplesfor rare classes during training, and it has in particularthe following advantages: (1) it is convenient to use andhighly versatile, because it can be easily integrated intoany kind of convolutional neural network, and it works wellwhen combined with different loss functions, and (2) it isonly used during the training phase, and therefore, no ad-ditional burden is imposed on deep neural networks duringthe testing phase. In extensive experimental evaluations, weverify the effectiveness of RSG. Furthermore, by leveragingRSG, we obtain competitive results on Imbalanced CIFARand new state-of-the-art results on Places-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

### 37.Effective Model Sparsification by Scheduled Grow-and-Prune Methods  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09857.pdf)
>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are effective in solving many real-world problems. Larger DNN models usually exhibit better quality (e.g., accuracy) but their excessive computation results in long training and inference time. Model sparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining model quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove weights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in each layer. The inefficiency of the algorithms reduces the achievable sparsity level. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained dense models and thus suffer from large memory footprint and long training time. In this paper, we propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without pre-training the dense models. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous works by repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning back to sparse after some training. Experiments have shown that such models can match or beat the quality of highly optimized dense models at 80% sparsity on a variety of tasks, such as image classification, objective detection, 3D object part segmentation, and translation. They also outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA) pruning methods, including pruning from pre-trained dense models. As an example, a 90% sparse ResNet-50 obtained via GaP achieves 77.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, improving the SOTA results by 1.5%.      
### 38.Dual-Teacher Class-Incremental Learning With Data-Free Generative Replay  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09835.pdf)
>  This paper proposes two novel knowledge transfer techniques for class-incremental learning (CIL). First, we propose data-free generative replay (DF-GR) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CIL by using synthetic samples from a generative model. In the conventional generative replay, the generative model is pre-trained for old data and shared in extra memory for later incremental learning. In our proposed DF-GR, we train a generative model from scratch without using any training data, based on the pre-trained classification model from the past, so we curtail the cost of sharing pre-trained generative models. Second, we introduce dual-teacher information distillation (DT-ID) for knowledge distillation from two teachers to one student. In CIL, we use DT-ID to learn new classes incrementally based on the pre-trained model for old classes and another model (pre-)trained on the new data for new classes. We implemented the proposed schemes on top of one of the state-of-the-art CIL methods and showed the performance improvement on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.      
### 39.Deep reinforcement learning with automated label extraction from clinical reports accurately classifies 3D MRI brain volumes  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09812.pdf)
>  Purpose: Image classification is perhaps the most fundamental task in imaging AI. However, labeling images is time-consuming and tedious. We have recently demonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI brain images with high accuracy. Here we make two important steps toward speeding image classification: Firstly, we automatically extract class labels from the clinical reports. Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work to fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows: in Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural language processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to train a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes. <br>Methods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions. We then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2. In Part 2, we applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep-Q learning using 3D convolutions and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 90 images. We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes predicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1. For comparison, we also trained and tested a supervised deep learning classification network on the same set of training and testing images using the same labels. <br>Results: Part 1: Upon training with the corpus of radiology reports, the SBERT model had 100% accuracy for both normal and metastasis-containing scans. Part 2: Then, using these labels, whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data and as expected performed poorly on the testing set (66% accuracy, just over random guessing), the reinforcement learning approach achieved an accuracy of 92%. The results were found to be statistically significant, with a p-value of 3.1 x 10^-5.      
### 40.Guided Integrated Gradients: An Adaptive Path Method for Removing Noise  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09788.pdf)
>  Integrated Gradients (IG) is a commonly used feature attribution method for deep neural networks. While IG has many desirable properties, the method often produces spurious/noisy pixel attributions in regions that are not related to the predicted class when applied to visual models. While this has been previously noted, most existing solutions are aimed at addressing the symptoms by explicitly reducing the noise in the resulting attributions. In this work, we show that one of the causes of the problem is the accumulation of noise along the IG path. To minimize the effect of this source of noise, we propose adapting the attribution path itself -- conditioning the path not just on the image but also on the model being explained. We introduce Adaptive Path Methods (APMs) as a generalization of path methods, and Guided IG as a specific instance of an APM. Empirically, Guided IG creates saliency maps better aligned with the model's prediction and the input image that is being explained. We show through qualitative and quantitative experiments that Guided IG outperforms other, related methods in nearly every experiment.      
### 41.Efficient Self-supervised Vision Transformers for Representation Learning  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09785.pdf)
>  This paper investigates two techniques for developing efficient self-supervised vision transformers (EsViT) for visual representation learning. First, we show through a comprehensive empirical study that multi-stage architectures with sparse self-attentions can significantly reduce modeling complexity but with a cost of losing the ability to capture fine-grained correspondences between image regions. Second, we propose a new pre-training task of region matching which allows the model to capture fine-grained region dependencies and as a result significantly improves the quality of the learned vision representations. Our results show that combining the two techniques, EsViT achieves 81.3% top-1 on the ImageNet linear probe evaluation, outperforming prior arts with around an order magnitude of higher throughput. When transferring to downstream linear classification tasks, EsViT outperforms its supervised counterpart on 17 out of 18 datasets. The code and models will be publicly available.      
### 42.Discovering Relationships between Object Categories via Universal Canonical Maps  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09758.pdf)
>  We tackle the problem of learning the geometry of multiple categories of deformable objects jointly. Recent work has shown that it is possible to learn a unified dense pose predictor for several categories of related objects. However, training such models requires to initialize inter-category correspondences by hand. This is suboptimal and the resulting models fail to maintain correct correspondences as individual categories are learned. In this paper, we show that improved correspondences can be learned automatically as a natural byproduct of learning category-specific dense pose predictors. To do this, we express correspondences between different categories and between images and categories using a unified embedding. Then, we use the latter to enforce two constraints: symmetric inter-category cycle consistency and a new asymmetric image-to-category cycle consistency. Without any manual annotations for the inter-category correspondences, we obtain state-of-the-art alignment results, outperforming dedicated methods for matching 3D shapes. Moreover, the new model is also better at the task of dense pose prediction than prior work.      
### 43.DeepLab2: A TensorFlow Library for Deep Labeling  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09748.pdf)
>  DeepLab2 is a TensorFlow library for deep labeling, aiming to provide a state-of-the-art and easy-to-use TensorFlow codebase for general dense pixel prediction problems in computer vision. DeepLab2 includes all our recently developed DeepLab model variants with pretrained checkpoints as well as model training and evaluation code, allowing the community to reproduce and further improve upon the state-of-art systems. To showcase the effectiveness of DeepLab2, our Panoptic-DeepLab employing Axial-SWideRNet as network backbone achieves 68.0% PQ or 83.5% mIoU on Cityscaspes validation set, with only single-scale inference and ImageNet-1K pretrained checkpoints. We hope that publicly sharing our library could facilitate future research on dense pixel labeling tasks and envision new applications of this technology.

### 44.CT Image Synthesis Using Weakly Supervised Segmentation and Geometric Inter-Label Relations For COVID Image Analysis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10230.pdf)
>  While medical image segmentation is an important task for computer aided diagnosis, the high expertise requirement for pixelwise manual annotations makes it a challenging and time consuming task. Since conventional data augmentations do not fully represent the underlying distribution of the training set, the trained models have varying performance when tested on images captured from different sources. Most prior work on image synthesis for data augmentation ignore the interleaved geometric relationship between different anatomical labels. We propose improvements over previous GAN-based medical image synthesis methods by learning the relationship between different anatomical labels. We use a weakly supervised segmentation method to obtain pixel level semantic label map of images which is used learn the intrinsic relationship of geometry and shape across semantic labels. Latent space variable sampling results in diverse generated images from a base image and improves robustness. We use the synthetic images from our method to train networks for segmenting COVID-19 infected areas from lung CT images. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods on a public dataset. Ablation studies also demonstrate benefits of integrating geometry and diversity.      
### 45.Residual Error: a New Performance Measure for Adversarial Robustness  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10212.pdf)
>  Despite the significant advances in deep learning over the past decade, a major challenge that limits the wide-spread adoption of deep learning has been their fragility to adversarial attacks. This sensitivity to making erroneous predictions in the presence of adversarially perturbed data makes deep neural networks difficult to adopt for certain real-world, mission-critical applications. While much of the research focus has revolved around adversarial example creation and adversarial hardening, the area of performance measures for assessing adversarial robustness is not well explored. Motivated by this, this study presents the concept of residual error, a new performance measure for not only assessing the adversarial robustness of a deep neural network at the individual sample level, but also can be used to differentiate between adversarial and non-adversarial examples to facilitate for adversarial example detection. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid model for approximating the residual error in a tractable manner. Experimental results using the case of image classification demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed residual error metric for assessing several well-known deep neural network architectures. These results thus illustrate that the proposed measure could be a useful tool for not only assessing the robustness of deep neural networks used in mission-critical scenarios, but also in the design of adversarially robust models.      
### 46.Non-Iterative Phase Retrieval With Cascaded Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10195.pdf)
>  Fourier phase retrieval is the problem of reconstructing a signal given only the magnitude of its Fourier transformation. Optimization-based approaches, like the well-established Gerchberg-Saxton or the hybrid input output algorithm, struggle at reconstructing images from magnitudes that are not oversampled. This motivates the application of learned methods, which allow reconstruction from non-oversampled magnitude measurements after a learning phase. In this paper, we want to push the limits of these learned methods by means of a deep neural network cascade that reconstructs the image successively on different resolutions from its non-oversampled Fourier magnitude. We evaluate our method on four different datasets (MNIST, EMNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and KMNIST) and demonstrate that it yields improved performance over other non-iterative methods and optimization-based methods.      
### 47.Steerable Partial Differential Operators for Equivariant Neural Networks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10163.pdf)
>  Recent work in equivariant deep learning bears strong similarities to physics. Fields over a base space are fundamental entities in both subjects, as are equivariant maps between these fields. In deep learning, however, these maps are usually defined by convolutions with a kernel, whereas they are partial differential operators (PDOs) in physics. Developing the theory of equivariant PDOs in the context of deep learning could bring these subjects even closer together and lead to a stronger flow of ideas. In this work, we derive a $G$-steerability constraint that completely characterizes when a PDO between feature vector fields is equivariant, for arbitrary symmetry groups $G$. We then fully solve this constraint for several important groups. We use our solutions as equivariant drop-in replacements for convolutional layers and benchmark them in that role. Finally, we develop a framework for equivariant maps based on Schwartz distributions that unifies classical convolutions and differential operators and gives insight about the relation between the two.      
### 48.World-GAN: a Generative Model for Minecraft Worlds  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10155.pdf)
>  This work introduces World-GAN, the first method to perform data-driven Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning in Minecraft from a single example. Based on a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, we are able to create arbitrarily sized world snippets from a given sample. We evaluate our approach on creations from the community as well as structures generated with the Minecraft World Generator. Our method is motivated by the dense representations used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) introduced with word2vec [1]. The proposed block2vec representations make World-GAN independent from the number of different blocks, which can vary a lot in Minecraft, and enable the generation of larger levels. Finally, we demonstrate that changing this new representation space allows us to change the generated style of an already trained generator. World-GAN enables its users to generate Minecraft worlds based on parts of their creations.      
### 49.Debiased Subjective Assessment of Real-World Image Enhancement  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10080.pdf)
>  In real-world image enhancement, it is often challenging (if not impossible) to acquire ground-truth data, preventing the adoption of distance metrics for objective quality assessment. As a result, one often resorts to subjective quality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating image enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually pre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three sources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of the selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential overfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential cherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world image enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards debiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of adaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting sample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the enhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual inspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the enhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using three popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing, super-resolution, and low-light enhancement.      
### 50.Improved Radar Localization on Lidar Maps Using Shared Embedding  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10000.pdf)
>  We present a heterogeneous localization framework for solving radar global localization and pose tracking on pre-built lidar maps. To bridge the gap of sensing modalities, deep neural networks are constructed to create shared embedding space for radar scans and lidar maps. Herein learned feature embeddings are supportive for similarity measurement, thus improving map retrieval and data matching respectively. In RobotCar and MulRan datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with the comparison to Scan Context and RaLL. In addition, the proposed pose tracking pipeline is with less neural networks compared to the original RaLL.      
### 51.Accumulative Poisoning Attacks on Real-time Data  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09993.pdf)
>  Collecting training data from untrusted sources exposes machine learning services to poisoning adversaries, who maliciously manipulate training data to degrade the model accuracy. When trained on offline datasets, poisoning adversaries have to inject the poisoned data in advance before training, and the order of feeding these poisoned batches into the model is stochastic. In contrast, practical systems are more usually trained/fine-tuned on sequentially captured real-time data, in which case poisoning adversaries could dynamically poison each data batch according to the current model state. In this paper, we focus on the real-time settings and propose a new attacking strategy, which affiliates an accumulative phase with poisoning attacks to secretly (i.e., without affecting accuracy) magnify the destructive effect of a (poisoned) trigger batch. By mimicking online learning and federated learning on CIFAR-10, we show that the model accuracy will significantly drop by a single update step on the trigger batch after the accumulative phase. Our work validates that a well-designed but straightforward attacking strategy can dramatically amplify the poisoning effects, with no need to explore complex techniques.      
### 52.Indicators of Attack Failure: Debugging and Improving Optimization of Adversarial Examples  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09947.pdf)
>  Evaluating robustness of machine-learning models to adversarial examples is a challenging problem. Many defenses have been shown to provide a false sense of security by causing gradient-based attacks to fail, and they have been broken under more rigorous evaluations. Although guidelines and best practices have been suggested to improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, the lack of automatic testing and debugging tools makes it difficult to apply these recommendations in a systematic manner. In this work, we overcome these limitations by (i) defining a set of quantitative indicators which unveil common failures in the optimization of gradient-based attacks, and (ii) proposing specific mitigation strategies within a systematic evaluation protocol. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed indicators of failure can be used to visualize, debug and improve current adversarial robustness evaluations, providing a first concrete step towards automatizing and systematizing current adversarial robustness evaluations. Our open-source code is available at: <a class="link-external link-https" href="https://github.com/pralab/IndicatorsOfAttackFailure" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>.      
### 53.Evolving GANs: When Contradictions Turn into Compliance  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09946.pdf)
>  Limited availability of labeled-data makes any supervised learning problem challenging. Alternative learning settings like semi-supervised and universum learning alleviate the dependency on labeled data, but still require a large amount of unlabeled data, which may be unavailable or expensive to acquire. GAN-based synthetic data generation methods have recently shown promise by generating synthetic samples to improve task at hand. However, these samples cannot be used for other purposes. In this paper, we propose a GAN game which provides improved discriminator accuracy under limited data settings, while generating realistic synthetic data. This provides the added advantage that now the generated data can be used for other similar tasks. We provide the theoretical guarantees and empirical results in support of our approach.      
### 54.A Unified Generative Adversarial Network Training via Self-Labeling and Self-Attention  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09914.pdf)
>  We propose a novel GAN training scheme that can handle any level of labeling in a unified manner. Our scheme introduces a form of artificial labeling that can incorporate manually defined labels, when available, and induce an alignment between them. To define the artificial labels, we exploit the assumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map nearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate categories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial conditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to self-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use the exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the classifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the training, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the labeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high classification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently improve the quality of generated data. More surprisingly, we find that the proposed scheme can even outperform class-conditional GANs.      
### 55.Development of a conversing and body temperature scanning autonomously navigating robot to help screen for COVID-19  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09894.pdf)
>  Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the most common symptom displayed by patients has been a fever, leading to the use of temperature scanning as a preemptive measure to detect potential carriers of the virus. Human employees with handheld thermometers have been used to fulfill this task, however this puts them at risk as they cannot be physically distanced and the sequential nature of this method leads to great inconveniences and inefficiency. The proposed solution is an autonomously navigating robot capable of conversing and scanning people's temperature to detect fevers and help screen for COVID-19. To satisfy this objective, the robot must be able to (1) navigate autonomously, (2) detect and track people, and (3) get individuals' temperature reading and converse with them if it exceeds 38°C. An autonomously navigating mobile robot is used with a manipulator controlled using a face tracking algorithm, and an end effector consisting of a thermal camera, smartphone, and chatbot. The goal is to develop a functioning solution that performs the above tasks. In addition, technical challenges encountered and their engineering solutions will be presented, and recommendations will be made for enhancements that could be incorporated when approaching commercialization.      
### 56.GEM: A General Evaluation Benchmark for Multimodal Tasks  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09889.pdf)
>  In this paper, we present GEM as a General Evaluation benchmark for Multimodal tasks. Different from existing datasets such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, XGLUE and XTREME that mainly focus on natural language tasks, GEM is a large-scale vision-language benchmark, which consists of GEM-I for image-language tasks and GEM-V for video-language tasks. Comparing with existing multimodal datasets such as MSCOCO and Flicker30K for image-language tasks, YouCook2 and MSR-VTT for video-language tasks, GEM is not only the largest vision-language dataset covering image-language tasks and video-language tasks at the same time, but also labeled in multiple languages. We also provide two baseline models for this benchmark. We will release the dataset, code and baseline models, aiming to advance the development of multilingual multimodal research.      
### 57.AI-Enabled Ultra-Low-Dose CT Reconstruction  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09834.pdf)
>  By the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle, ultra-low-dose CT reconstruction is a holy grail to minimize cancer risks and genetic damages, especially for children. With the development of medical CT technologies, the iterative algorithms are widely used to reconstruct decent CT images from a low-dose scan. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have shown a great promise in further reducing CT radiation dose to the next level. In this paper, we demonstrate that AI-powered CT reconstruction offers diagnostic image quality at an ultra-low-dose level comparable to that of radiography. Specifically, here we develop a Split Unrolled Grid-like Alternative Reconstruction (SUGAR) network, in which deep learning, physical modeling and image prior are integrated. The reconstruction results from clinical datasets show that excellent images can be reconstructed using SUGAR from 36 projections. This approach has a potential to change future healthcare.      
### 58.Hybrid graph convolutional neural networks for landmark-based anatomical segmentation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09832.pdf)
>  In this work we address the problem of landmark-based segmentation for anatomical structures. We propose HybridGNet, an encoder-decoder neural architecture which combines standard convolutions for image feature encoding, with graph convolutional neural networks to decode plausible representations of anatomical structures. We benchmark the proposed architecture considering other standard landmark and pixel-based models for anatomical segmentation in chest x-ray images, and found that HybridGNet is more robust to image occlusions. We also show that it can be used to construct landmark-based segmentations from pixel level annotations. Our experimental results suggest that HybridGNet produces accurate and anatomically plausible landmark-based segmentations, by naturally incorporating shape constraints within the decoding process via spectral convolutions.      
### 59.A Distance-based Separability Measure for Internal Cluster Validation  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09794.pdf)
>  To evaluate clustering results is a significant part of cluster analysis. Since there are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised learning, many internal cluster validity indices (CVIs), which use predicted labels and data, have been created. Without true labels, to design an effective CVI is as difficult as to create a clustering method. And it is crucial to have more CVIs because there are no universal CVIs that can be used to measure all datasets and no specific methods of selecting a proper CVI for clusters without true labels. Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering results is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI -- the Distance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure. We compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn (1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using clustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic datasets. Results show DSI is an effective, unique, and competitive CVI to other compared CVIs. We also summarized the general process to evaluate CVIs and created the rank-difference metric for comparison of CVIs' results.      
### 60.Synthetic COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset for Computer-Aided Diagnosis  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09759.pdf)
>  We introduce a new dataset called Synthetic COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset for training machine learning models. The dataset consists of 21,295 synthetic COVID-19 chest X-ray images to be used for computer-aided diagnosis. These images, generated via an unsupervised domain adaptation approach, are of high quality. We find that the synthetic images not only improve performance of various deep learning architectures when used as additional training data under heavy imbalance conditions, but also detect the target class with high confidence. We also find that comparable performance can also be achieved when trained only on synthetic images. Further, salient features of the synthetic COVID-19 images indicate that the distribution is significantly different from Non-COVID-19 classes, enabling a proper decision boundary. We hope the availability of such high fidelity chest X-ray images of COVID-19 will encourage advances in the development of diagnostic and/or management tools.      
### 61.PyKale: Knowledge-Aware Machine Learning from Multiple Sources in Python  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09756.pdf)
>  Machine learning is a general-purpose technology holding promises for many interdisciplinary research problems. However, significant barriers exist in crossing disciplinary boundaries when most machine learning tools are developed in different areas separately. We present Pykale - a Python library for knowledge-aware machine learning on graphs, images, texts, and videos to enable and accelerate interdisciplinary research. We formulate new green machine learning guidelines based on standard software engineering practices and propose a novel pipeline-based application programming interface (API). PyKale focuses on leveraging knowledge from multiple sources for accurate and interpretable prediction, thus supporting multimodal learning and transfer learning (particularly domain adaptation) with latest deep learning and dimensionality reduction models. We build PyKale on PyTorch and leverage the rich PyTorch ecosystem. Our pipeline-based API design enforces standardization and minimalism, embracing green machine learning concepts via reducing repetitions and redundancy, reusing existing resources, and recycling learning models across areas. We demonstrate its interdisciplinary nature via examples in bioinformatics, knowledge graph, image/video recognition, and medical imaging.      
### 62.AtrialGeneral: Domain Generalization for Left Atrial Segmentation of Multi-Center LGE MRIs  [ :arrow_down: ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08727.pdf)
>  Left atrial (LA) segmentation from late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE MRI) is a crucial step needed for planning the treatment of atrial fibrillation. However, automatic LA segmentation from LGE MRI is still challenging, due to the poor image quality, high variability in LA shapes, and unclear LA boundary. Though deep learning-based methods can provide promising LA segmentation results, they often generalize poorly to unseen domains, such as data from different scanners and/or sites. In this work, we collect 210 LGE MRIs from different centers with different levels of image quality. To evaluate the domain generalization ability of models on the LA segmentation task, we employ four commonly used semantic segmentation networks for the LA segmentation from multi-center LGE MRIs. Besides, we investigate three domain generalization strategies, i.e., histogram matching, mutual information based disentangled representation, and random style transfer, where a simple histogram matching is proved to be most effective.
